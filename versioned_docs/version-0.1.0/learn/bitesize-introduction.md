title: About Bitesize Samples
---

The Bitesize Samples repository provides a series of sample code as modules to use in your games and better understand Unity MLAPI.

* [2D Space Shooter Sample](bitesize-spaceshooter.md) - Learn more about physics movement and status effects using MLAPI NetworkVariables and ObjectPooling.
* [Invaders Sample](bitesize-invaders.md) - Learn more about game flow, modes, unconventional movement networked, and a shared timer.

## Requirements

You need Unity and Unity MLAPI installed to work with these samples. See [Install MLAPI](../migration/installation.md) for details.

## Get the packages

You can download the projects from the [Bitesize Samples GitHub](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.samples.bitesize) repo, adding them to your project and code.

## Troubleshooting

**Error building**

Error: Error building Player: Currently selected scripting backend (IL2CPP) is not installed.

Currently, you may need to have [Unity IL2CPP](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/IL2CPP.html) installed. Bitesize Samples should not require IL2CPP, and may have updates to resolve this error.
