## Unity 2021.x

This guide assumes that you already have:
  * Git installed on your PC. If you don't already have it, download [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and restart your system. A full restart is required to update Git or you may receive an error adding packages.
  * An active Unity account with a valid license.
  * A current installation of Unity.
  * An existing Unity project. If you haven't created a project yet, we recommend using the [Hello World](../tutorials/helloworld/helloworldintro.md) example to begin.

1. Open your **Unity Hub** and select the **Project** you are presently working on.
1. From the menu bar, navigate to **Window** > **Package Manager**.
1. Click the plus sign ([Add](/img/add.png)) in the **Package Manager** status bar and select **Add pack from git URL...**.
1. Copy and paste the following Git URL to the MLAPI release package in the pop-up window:
```
https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.mlapi.git?path=/com.unity.multiplayer.mlapi#release/0.1.0
```
  :::info How to Copy
  We recommend that you use the **Copy** function in the code block above to copy the URL as other methods may result in errors. Just hover and click.

## Unity 2019.4+ and 2020.x

To install MLAPI on Unity versions 2019.4 and later and 2020.x, use the Unity Package Manager passing a git URL to the MLAPI release:

1. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/) if you do not have it installed on your PC. After installing Git, restart your system. A full restart is required to update for Git or you may receive an error adding packages.

1. Open the Unity Package Manager by navigating to **Window** > **Package Manager** on Unityâ€™s main menu.
1. Click ![Add](/img/add.png) in the status bar and select **Add package from git URL...** (due to the package being experimental).

  ```
  https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.mlapi.git?path=/com.unity.multiplayer.mlapi#release/0.1.0
  ```

  :::info How to Copy
  We recommend that you use the **Copy** function in the code block above to copy the URL as other methods may result in errors. Just hover and click.

### Errors with incorrect package loading


If you receive a different package than Unity MLAPI when adding the URL to Unity Hub, you may have not correctly copied the GitHub URL. 

Hover over the URL to copy, click the **Copy** function in the code block, and use this when adding the package from a Git URL in Unity Hub.

**Errors adding package**

MacOS users may receive the following errors:

* `Cannot perform upm operation: Unable to add package... Error when executing git command. xcrun: error: invalid active developer path`
* `Error adding package...`

These are common errors for MacOS users that have not installed or updated Xcode or Xcode developer tools. You may need to upgrade your Xcode installation. In a terminal, use this command: `xcode-select --install`.

If you newly installed or updated Git, you may also need to restart your system. Restarting Unity may not be enough if you added Git and could receive a package loading error.

**Errors finding Git installation**

If you receive an OS or Unity error trying to locate Git after updating or installing Git, you need to fully restart your computer. Restarting only Unity may not fully update system information to correctly locate the install.

**VPN or Proxy Errors**

If you use VPN or proxy software from international locations, you may encounter access issues. Use the registry option for installing MLAPI. Also consider turning off your VPN service or selecting a different location.
