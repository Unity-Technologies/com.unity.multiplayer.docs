## Troubleshooting

You may come across different errors when installing Netcode. The following troubleshooting tips should help you with the most common issues.


### Errors with incorrect package loading


If you receive a different package than  Netcode for GameObjects Version 1.0.0-pre.2  when adding the URL to Unity Hub, you may have not correctly copied the GitHub URL. 

Hover over the URL to copy, click the **Copy** function in the code block, and use this when adding the package from a Git URL in Unity Hub.

**Errors adding package**

MacOS users may receive the following errors:

* `Cannot perform upm operation: Unable to add package... Error when executing git command. xcrun: error: invalid active developer path`
* `Error adding package...`

These are common errors for MacOS users that have not installed or updated Xcode or Xcode developer tools. You may need to upgrade your Xcode installation. In a terminal, use this command: `xcode-select --install`.

If you newly installed or updated Git, you may also need to restart your system. Restarting Unity may not be enough if you added Git and could receive a package loading error.

**Errors finding Git installation**

If you receive an OS or Unity error trying to locate Git after updating or installing Git, you need to fully restart your computer. Restarting only Unity may not fully update system information to correctly locate the install.

**VPN or Proxy Errors**

If you use VPN or proxy software from international locations, you may encounter access issues. Use the registry option for installing MLAPI. Also consider turning off your VPN service or selecting a different location.
