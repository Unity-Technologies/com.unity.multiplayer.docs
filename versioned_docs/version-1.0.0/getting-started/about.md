title: Getting Started with Netcode
---

Netcode is a mid-level networking library built for the Unity game engine to abstract networking. This allows you, the developer to focus on your game rather than low-level protocols and networking frameworks.

## Before you begin

Netcode supports the following versions:
* Unity 2020.3, 2021.1, and 2021.2
* Mono and IL2CPP [Scripting Backends](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/scripting-backends.html)

Netcode supports the following platforms:
* Windows, MacOS, and Linux
* iOS and Android
* XR platforms running on Windows, Android, and iOS operating systems
* Most [**closed platforms**](https://unity.com/platform-installation), such as consoles. Contact us for more information about specific closed platforms.

:::caution Using WebGL
Netcode does not support the WebGL platform because it does not allow access to IP Sockets.

There are third party transports provided by the community that may enable you to use Netcode on WebGL platforms. A list of these transports are found [here](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/multiplayer-community-contributions#transports).

Use with caution:
* You may encounter bugs and issues while using Netcode on WebGL, and we will not prioritize fixing those issues.
* The server or host cannot be a WebGL client, but a Desktop or Mobile build.
* You may experience **increased** latency and jitter because of the TCP protocol used by WebSockets.
