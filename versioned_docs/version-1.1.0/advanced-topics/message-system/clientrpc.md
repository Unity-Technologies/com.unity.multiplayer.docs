Servers can invoke a `ClientRpc` to execute on all clients.

## Declaring a ClientRpc

You can declare a `ClientRpc` by marking a method with `[ClientRpc]` attribute and including the `ClientRpc` suffix in the method name.

```csharp
[ClientRpc]
void PongClientRpc(int somenumber, string sometext) { /* ... */ }
```

## Invoking a ClientRpc

You can invoke a `ClientRpc` by making a direct function call with parameters:

```csharp
void Update()
{
    if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.P))
    {
        PongClientRpc(Time.frameCount, "hello, world"); // Server -> Client
    }
}
```

You must mark client RPC methods with the `[ClientRpc]` attribute and use the `ClientRpc` method suffix; failing to do so results in an error message.

```csharp
// Error: Invalid, missing 'ClientRpc' suffix in the method name
[ClientRpc]
void Pong(int somenumber, string sometext) { /* ... */ }

// Error: Invalid, missing [ClientRpc] attribute on the method
void PongClientRpc(int somenumber, string sometext) { /* ... */ }
```

The `[ClientRpc]` attribute and matching `...ClientRpc` suffix in the method name are there to ensure RPC call sites know when they're executing an RPC. The client RPC replicates and executes client-side, without jumping into the original RPC method declaration to find out if it's an RPC.

```csharp
Pong(somenumber, sometext); // Is this an RPC call?

PongRpc(somenumber, sometext); // Is this a ServerRpc call or ClientRpc call?

PongClientRpc(somenumber, sometext); // This is clearly a ClientRpc call
```

## To Send to One Client, use ClientRpcSendParameters

The following code provides an example of using `ClientRpcSendParameters`, which sends a `ClientRpc` to a specific client connections. The default Netcode for GameObjects's behavior is to broadcast to every single client.

```csharp
private void DoSomethingServerSide(int clientId)
    {
        // If isn't the Server/Host then we should early return here!
        if (!IsServer) return;


        // NOTE! In case you know a list of ClientId's ahead of time, that does not need change,
        // Then please consider caching this (as a member variable), to avoid Allocating Memory every time you run this function
        ClientRpcParams clientRpcParams = new ClientRpcParams
        {
            Send = new ClientRpcSendParams
            {
                TargetClientIds = new ulong[]{clientId}
            }
        };

        // Let's imagine that you need to compute a Random integer and want to send that to a client
        const int maxValue = 4;
        int randomInteger = Random.Range(0, maxValue);
        DoSomethingClientRpc(randomInteger, clientRpcParams);
    }

    [ClientRpc]
    private void DoSomethingClientRpc(int randomInteger, ClientRpcParams clientRpcParams = default)
    {
        if (IsOwner) return;

        // Run your client-side logic here!!
        Debug.LogFormat("GameObject: {0} has received a randomInteger with value: {1}", gameObject.name, randomInteger);
    }
```

 <figcaption>Server can invoke a client RPC on a Network Object. The RPC will be placed in the local queue and then sent to a selection of clients (by default this selection is "all clients"). When received by a client, RPC will be executed on the client's version of the same Network Object.</figcaption>

## Invoking a Client RPC from the Host

The host is both a client and a server. If a host invokes a client RPC, it triggers the on all clients, including the host.

 <figcaption>Hosts can invoke client RPCs on `NetworkObjects`. The RPC will be placed in the local queue. After a short delay, the client RPC executes on the host and all other clients. When a client receives a client RPC it's executed on that client's version of the same `NetworkObject`.</figcaption>
