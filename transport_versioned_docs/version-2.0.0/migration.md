title: Migration from 1.X
description: How to deal with breaking changes introduced in version 2.0 of Unity Transport.
---

This section describes the breaking changes introduced in version 2.0 of the Unity Transport Package (UTP). It also explains how to update projects written for version 1.X.

**Note**: In most use cases, thereâ€™s no need to perform any additional steps to migrate from 1.X to 2.0. The core APIs like `NetworkDriver` remain the same, and the most significant changes are limited to specialized scenarios, such as [custom network interfaces](custom-network-interface.md).

## Editor version support

UTP 1.X supports Unity Editor 2020.3 and up, but 2.0 only supports 2022.2 and up to keep the `Collections` package dependency up to date. Unity Editor 2022.2 brings many changes to the core engine runtime, allowing more code to be Burst-compiled. UTP benefits from this through increased performance.

**Note**: UTP 1.X remains fully supported on LTS versions 2020.3 and 2021.3, and Unity will continue to release bug fixes and improvements. However, some features (like WebSocket support) will only be available in UTP 2.0 and up.

## `DataStreamReader`/`DataStreamWriter` moved to `Collections`

UTP 2.0 moves the `DataStreamReader` and `DataStreamWriter` APIs to the `Collections` package to make them more widely available outside UTP. Consequently, updating to UTP 2.0 might require you to add a `Unity.Collections` directive at the top of files using the `DataStreamReader` and `DataStreamWriter` APIs.

The APIs are mostly unchanged, except for raw pointers. `Unity.Collections.LowLevel.Unsafe` namespace provides the raw pointer methods with `Unsafe` appended to their names. For example, the method `WriteBytes(byte*, int)` is now `WriteBytesUnsafe(byte*, int)`.

## Protocol incompatibility

The custom communication protocol UTP uses to implement connections over UDP has changed in a backward-incompatible manner, which means clients running UTP 2.0 or later can't connect to servers running 1.X, and vice versa. If you attempt to establish a connection between UTP 2.0 and UTP 1.X, it returns a connection failure after the usual timeout.

Due to the incompatibility between UTP 2.0 and UTP 1.X, you must either ensure that you either update clients and servers simultaneously or disallow older clients from connecting to updated servers. Alternatively, you can provide different endpoints for UTP 1.X and 2.0 servers to smooth the transition while older clients are updated.

These breaking changes introduced in UTP 2.0 improve bandwidth efficiency, simplify the protocol, and lay the foundations for better forward compatibility.

## Custom network interfaces

The updates in UTP 2.0 heavily modify the `INetworkInterface` API used to implement custom network interfaces (the low-level layer to send and receive packets) to simplify it.

UTP 2.0 introduces the following breaking changes to custom network interfaces: 

* UTP 2.0 no longer has the concept of `NetworkInterfaceEndPoint`; the more general `NetworkEndpoint` replaces `NetworkInterfaceEndPoint`. As a result, you do not need to implement conversion logic between `NetworkEndpoint` and `NetworkInterfaceEndPoint` anymore, so `INetworkInterface` omits `CreateInterfaceEndPoint` and `GetGenericEndPoint`.
* You no longer need to provide a `NetworkSendInterface` through `CreateSendInterface`. `ScheduleSend` handles `Send` operations, which get passed a `PacketsQueue` containing the packets to send.
* The `ScheduleReceive` method doesn't use the (now obsolete) `NetworkPacketReceiver` to propagate received packets to the rest of UTP. Instead, implementations of `ScheduleReceive` should fill the `PacketsQueue` passed in with the received packets.
* Implementations of `INetworkInterface` must now be fully compatible with Burst. If an implementation is incompatible with Burst, you can wrap it into a compatible implementation with the new `WrapToUnmanaged` extension method.
* You must now create `NetworkDriver`s using a custom network interface using the static `NetworkDriver.Create` method. For example, `NetworkDriver.Create(new MyCustomInterface())` creates a `NetworkDriver `named `MyCustomInterface()`. Directly constructing a `NetworkDriver` with `new` is deprecated.
* `INetworkInterface.Initialize` now takes another parameter: a reference to the packet padding, and you can increase this value to reserve space for headers.

These breaking changes simplify and increase the flexibility of the interface. See [Custom network interfaces](custom-network-interface.md) for more details on creating custom network interfaces.

## Pipeline stages

UTP 2.0 does not introduce changes to how you write custom pipeline stages. However, the mechanisms you should use to register and get the identifier of a pipeline stage have changed:

* Instead of registering a custom pipeline stage with `NetworkPipelineStageCollection.RegisterPipelineStage`, use `NetworkDriver.RegisterPipelineStage`. Note: You must perform this change on every instance of `NetworkDriver` that uses the custom pipeline stage.
* Instead of retrieving the ID of a pipeline stage with `NetworkPipelineStageCollection.GetStageId`, use the static `NetworkPipelineStageId.Get` method.

These breaking changes remove Burst-incompatible APIs, allowing you to use more of UTP with Burst-compiled code. 

For more information, see [Creating a custom pipeline stage](custom-pipeline.md) and [Pipeline usage](pipelines-usage.md).

## Other breaking changes

In addition to the changes around data streams, custom network interfaces, and pipeline stages, UTP 2.0 also introduces the following breaking changes:

* You must now complete a `NetworkDriver.ScheduleUpdate` job when notifying the remote peer of the disconnection after calling `NetworkDriver.Disconnect`. In 1.X, `NetworkDriver.ScheduleFlushSend` was sufficient to notify a remote peer of a disconnection, but this is not the case with UTP 2.0. This change supports new protocols, such as WebSockets, where disconnecting might involve more work than simply sending a message.
* Using `SimulatorPipelineStageInSend` is now deprecated. Instead, use `SimulatorPipelineStage` and configure the new `ApplyMode` parameter to the direction (for example, `send`, `receive`, or both).
* `NetworkSettings.WithBaselibNetworkInterfaceParameters` is now deprecated. You can no longer configure the maximum payload size; UTP handles the payload size automatically. However, you can configure the receive and send queue sizes with `NetworkSettings.WithNetworkConfigParameters`.
* UTP 2.0 removes `NetworkSettings.WithDataStreamParameters` and `NetworkSettings.WithPipelineParameters`. You no longer need to manually configure either of these parameters, so the methods are unnecessary. You can safely delete calls to these methods.
* You no longer need to configure `Read` and handshake timeouts through `NetworkSettings.WithSecureClientParameters` and `NetworkSettings.WithSecureServerParameters`. Instead, UTP derives the values automatically from other configuration parameters. You can safely remove these settings from these calls.
