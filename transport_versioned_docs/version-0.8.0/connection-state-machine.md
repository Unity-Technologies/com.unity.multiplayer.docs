title: Understand the Connection State Machine
---

It's important to at least understand how transitions occur in the connection state machine so you make decisions depending on what triggered each state. And to understand the subtle differences depending if you are `Connecting` to another host or if you simply want to Listen for incoming connections. As you can see below the state machine for the `NetworkConnection` is pretty simple.

All connections start in `Disconnected` state.

Depending what state the `NetworkDriver` is in, the `Listening (Passive)` state might be triggered. This is when the driver acts like a server listening for incoming connections and data requests. And secondly you could try to use the driver to connect to a remote endpoint and then we would invoke another flow of the state machine.

So to give a overview we have two standard scenarios. Either you listen for incoming connections or you use and outgoing connection to connect to someone else.

In the [client/server workflow](workflow-client-server.md), use the `ServerBehaviour` to `Listen` and the `ClientBehaviour` to `Connect`.
