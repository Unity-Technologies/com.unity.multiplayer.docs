The Unity Multiplayer Networking documentation site is live with updated and new content, tutorials, glossary, troubleshooting, API reference, and much more.

## Everything is a click away

The new doc site provides top navigation for immediate content, quick links for community information and contacts, a search, and dark/light mode! Each page includes a side navigation for content in the section and on the page. Charts and workflows use Mermaid. And we support tabbed content, videos, animations, and so much more.

Take us on the go! The site is fully responsive for desktops and devices, with new features being added as needed.
