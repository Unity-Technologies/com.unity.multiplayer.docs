Welcome to the Unity Multiplayer Networking documentation site, where we support Open Source for code and docs! 

This site is designed to provide you with the guides, references, APIs, tutorials, release notes, and more that you need to be successful with Unity Multiplayer features, including MLAPI and Transport. The blog goes further, highlighting announcements, featured contributions, team information, tips and tricks, and community spotlights. 

We can’t wait to see what you create!

## What's under the hood?

The documentation is written in Markdown with MDX and HTML support. See the [Contribution Guide](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.docs/wiki/Working-with-Markdown) and [template sample](/docs/template) to learn more about options and features available when writing content.

The site builds using the following Open Source tools:

* [Docusaurus v2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/) for all content and blog
* [DocFX](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/) with [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) conversion for API reference
* [Algolia DocSearch](https://v2.docusaurus.io/docs/search) for search (in progress)

## What to expect!

Documentation will update as needed and with releases. We follow CI/CD processes to submit, review, and publish updates and content, per feedback, submitted issues, and as development releases new packages.

We look forward to holding Doc-A-Thon events, highlighting contributors, and much more to deliver the content you need and want. Contact us on [Discord](http://discord.mlapi.network/) in the Documentation channel and through our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.docs).

Let's get started!
