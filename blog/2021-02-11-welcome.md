Welcome to the Unity Multiplayer documentation site. We support Open Source for code and docs! 

This site provides guides, references, APIs, tutorials, release notes, and more for all Unity Multiplayer features, including MLAPI and Transport. The blog goes further, highlighting announcements, featured contributions, team information, tips and tricks, and community spotlights.

## How do I provide feedback?

We give you many options to send feedback on issues, missing content, requests for tutorials, submitting changes, and more:

| Write Content | Submit Feedback |
| -- | -- |

## How do I contribute?

Being Open Source, this doc site welcomes all contributions including typo fixes, new content, and tutorials. Contribute by cloning, forking or branching, writing content, and submitting a PR. 

The [Contribution Guide](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.docs/wiki) helps you get started:

* Clone the repo.
* Create a fork or branches.
* Write content.
* Work with Markdown.
* Submit PRs for consideration.

The doc team will review your submissions, provides feedback, and help get the content added to navigation and the site!

## What's under the hood?

The documentation is written in Markdown with MDX and HTML support. See the [Contribution Guide](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.docs/wiki/Working-with-Markdown) and [template sample](/docs/template) to learn more about options and features available when writing content.

The site builds using the following Open Source tools:

* [Docusaurus v2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/) for all content and blog
* [DocFX](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/) with [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) conversion for API reference
* [Algolia DocSearch](https://v2.docusaurus.io/docs/search) for search

## What to expect!

Documentation will update as needed and with releases. We follow CI/CD processes to submit, review, and publish updates and content, per feedback, submitted issues, and as development releases new packages.

We look forward to holding Doc-A-Thon events, highlighting contributors, and much more to deliver the content you need and want. Contact us on [Discord](http://discord.mlapi.network/) in the Documentation channel and through our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.docs).

Our product leads also provide a [public roadmap](/docs/roadmap) to view, submit, and vote on features for Multiplayer.
