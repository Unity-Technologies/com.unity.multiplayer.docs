description: Unity Multiplayer Bitesize Samples gives you helpful modular pieces of code to quickly develop games and learn MLAPI.
---

As you begin learning MLAPI and building multiplayer games with Unity, you may need a little help. Something smaller and bitesize! Modular code is key.

We may have just the answer! Unity Multiplayer Bitesize Samples is a new repository giving you a library of modular projects to quickly develop your game. Each modular piece of code focuses on a different type of gameplay, game feature, options, and more while showcasing and dog-fooding Unity MLAPI code.

The [Multiplayer Bitesize Samples respository](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.samples.bitesize) is ready for you to clone and incorporate into your games. It supports Unity MLAPI 0.1.0 and Unity 2020.3.

## What do I need to get started?

You need Unity and [Unity MLAPI installed](/docs/migration/install) to use these samples. Complete the [Hello World Getting Started](/docs/tutorials/helloworld/helloworldintro) to prepare your environment. You can then access and use these samples to MLAPI in a more self-contained scenario.

## What's available right now?
