You [saved the date](https://unity.com/demos/small-scale-coop-sample), and now Boss Room is public and live April 7, 2021!

Boss Room leverages the new experimental netcode package to bring up to eight players together to defeat imps and a boss in this adorable vertical slice of a cooperative RPG dungeon. This small-scale cooperative game is built to teach you the underlying networking patterns and concepts behind a multiplayer game of its genre. 

The Boss Room project equips you with all the project files and assets you need to explore the creation of a small-scale cooperative game packed with playable characters, enemies, and a boss. As Boss Room is being developed, tutorials on the different aspects of networking the sample will be written for developers right here on our live documentation site – so stay tuned!
