title: Enable Virtual Players
description: You can enable up to 3 additional Virtual Players to your Main Editor Player in Multiplayer Play Mode.
---

In [**Play mode**](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/GameView.html), you only have the default **Main Editor Player** to test your gameplay. By adding the **Multiplayer Play Mode (MPPM)** package, you can enable up to 3 additional **Virtual Players** to the **Play mode** for a total of 4 players.

:::important
You can only attach **Player Tags** to inactive players (including the **Main Editor Player**). If you plan to use **Player Tags**, [create and configure your tags](../player-tags) first.

## Enable a Virtual Player

:::note
You must enable your **Virtual Players** before entering **Play mode**.
:::

To enable **Virtual Players** for **Play mode**,

1. In the **Unity Editor**, open the **MPPM** window by navigating to **Window** > **Multiplayer Play Mode**.
2. If you want to use **Player Tags** for any of your players, select the **Player Tag** from the **Tag** dropdown associated with each player. **Player Tags** can only be added to inactive players before entering **Play mode**.
3. Select the checkbox for each **Virtual Player** (Player 2, Player 3, or Player 4) you want to add to **Play mode**.
4. Wait for the player status to change from inactive to active for each **Virtual Player** you selected.
5. Once active, the **Virtual Player(s)** appear in **Play mode** in the **Main Editor** window. A separate window opens for each enabled player with the player name as the window title.
