title: Configure a Player to simulate different network connections example
description: This example shows how you can use the Network Simulator and Players to test different network connections in Multiplayer Play Mode.
---

The logic in the following example checks if the **Player Tag** has a string rather than if itâ€™s equal to a string to allow for more flexibility with the name of the **Player Tag**. You can change this logic so that it checks for an exact match.

## Simulate network conditions

This example script uses the Network Simulation Presets from the [Multiplayer Tools package](https://docs-multiplayer.unity3d.com/tools/current/install-tools/) to automatically simulate a fast or slow network based on the Player Tag. A Player with the `FastNetwork` Player Tag simulates a common [Home Broadband](https://docs-multiplayer.unity3d.com/tools/current/tools-network-simulator/#home-broadband-connections) connection, and a Player with the `SlowNetwork` Player Tag simulates a [Mobile 2.5G](https://docs-multiplayer.unity3d.com/tools/current/tools-network-simulator/#mobile-25g) connection.

:::note
This example uses the [Network Simulator](https://docs-multiplayer.unity3d.com/tools/current/tools-network-simulator/) tool from the `com.unity.multiplayer.tools` package.
