    * Baked 3x1024 and 1x128 lightmaps (about 4MB), these are for area lights to make the lava glow more convincing
    * Added little blob shadows to characters (a plane with a transparent soft black circle attached to the physics object in the character prefab)
    * Changed the lights for the enemy spawners from point lights to spot lights (still not shadow casting)
    * Rotated all of the little pots to be in different directions so they don't look so copy-pasted

[1.0.0-pre] - 2021-10-21

## New features and changes

This release includes the following new features:

* Player persistence hierarchical modifications to Netcode's Player Prefab
* Radio button introduced for main menu UX improvements (default is still IP)
* Archer's base attack & charged shot 1-3 replicated via NetworkTransform
* NetworkTransform handles players' movement syncing
* Adding ParrelSync and updating third party notice.md
* NetworkAnimator added to boss door & floor switch with server-authority
* Integrating Unity Transport and Relay into Boss Room
* Updated image in the UnityLogo prefab with the new Unity logo
* NetworkObject pool (arrows are pooled)
* Server-authoritative character NetworkAnimator

And the following changes:

* Collider and Layer cleanup & optimizations
* Photon Transport send queue batch size incremented to 8192
* OnNetworkSpawn() refactoring, player prefab removed from NetworkManager prefab list
* Netcode rebranding
* Added link to bitesize samples
* Update compatible Unity version in Readme
* Renaming connection methods in main menu
* Updated Animations to use an additional anticipation animation, to properly work with NetworkAnimator
* Updated actions to latest NetworkAnimator APIs

## Fixes

This release includes the following fixes:

* A Netcode soft sync error on cleanup between scene transitions previously broke the game. For example imps did not spawn and pots were intangible.
* Sometimes after completing a match and the host starts a new match from the Victory or Loss screen, connected players had no visible interactions to join or select characters.
* Sometimes the client may have been disconnected from Photon which caused a timeout and PhotonRealtimeTransport to be in a bad state after the shutdown. An exception developed that fired every frame.

## Known issues
* The game can be initiated while a second player is connecting to the host in CharSelect. Players may join without selected characters spawning and in an unresponsive state.
* The game may not transition completely into the game scene past the character select screen on lower-end Android devices.
* This version currently includes a patched NetworkAnimator. This will be reverted back once this patch goes live in Netcode for GameObjects
