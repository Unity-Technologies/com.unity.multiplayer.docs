## [0.2.1] - 2021-05-27

v0.2.1 is a hotfix for an Early Access release for Boss Room: Small Scale Co-op Sample.

### Fixes

* GitHub 343 - Fixed parameter exception when connecting to lobby caused by an old MLAPI version. This fix reverts the change until the package is updated.

## [0.2.0] - 2021-05-19

## New features

This release includes the following new features and additions:

* Introduced static scene `NetworkObject`s to Boss Room scene including the following updates:<!-- GOMPS-381 PR 292-->

    * Implemented a `ScriptableObject` based event system to encapsulate events inside assets. These objects include a `GameEvent` (ScriptableObject) and `GameEventListener` (MonoBehaviour) to encapsulate events inside assets, located in the `ServerBossRoomState` prefab which now has a `GameEventListener` component. The event associated to this listener is `BossDefeated`, which the Boss raises when the `LifeState` is Dead in the `RaiseEventOnLifeChange` component.
    * Added two separator `GameObject`s for scene readability: runtime `NetworkObject`s and `NetworkObject`s already placed in the scene.
    * Added a custom editor for GameEvents to fire in the editor (greatly enhances testing).
    * The `LifeState` `NetworkVariable` was moved from `NetworkCharacterState` into its own component, `NetworkLifeState`.
    * Cleaned up and removed old spawn prefab collections and spawner scripts (`NetSpawnPoint`).

* Added ramp-up animation for hero movement and actions <!-- GOMPS-122 GOMPS-472-->
* Added F/X and animation assets for the game including:

  * Audio files for boss sound effects <!--  GOMPS-110 -->
  * Visual effects and particles for Tank charge skill <!-- GOMPS-237 GOMPS-238 -->
  * Art assets to wave spawner, including animations for ReceiveDamage, Broken (died), and Revive <!-- GOMPS-123 -->

* Added Boss fight theme. <!-- GOMPS-128 -->
* Updated and added various hero abilities:

  * Added a cooldown to Archer's PowerShot.
  * Added the Rogue's Dagger and Dash skills. The dash skill shows an instinct teleport (using an RPC) instead of a charge like the boss' (which updates its position over time). <!-- GOMPS-483 GOMPS-16 GOMPS-65 -->
  * Added the Rogue's Sneak skill using local stealth, applying a graphical effect to the stealthy character while still sending all network events normally. <!--  GOMPS-64 -->
  * Properly display Heal abilities when targeting a fallen ally character. <!-- GOMPS-454 -->
  * Character attack actions properly support Hold to charge options. <!-- GOMPS-455 -->

* To show how UI elements and game objects can be networked, added networked functionality using `INetworkSerializable` in the `CharSelect` screen to network player's selected character on the Character Selection screen. <!-- GOMPS-174 -->
* Added input sanitization to remove any invisible characters introduced by other chat programs when copy-pasting room names, IP addresses, or ports. (Useful when sharing with friends.)
* Added disconnection error message to load when a player or host disconnects. Client logic was also updated to detect Host disconnection scenarios, such as losting connectivity. <!-- GOMPS-448 GOMPS-470 -->
* Balanced hero and enemy stats, spawners, trigger areas, and enemy detetction areas. <!-- GOMPS-249, 251 -->
* Added healthbars to display when damaged and properly track imp health locally and across clients. <!-- GOMPS-450 -->

## Changes

* The Boss Room project now loads MLAPI 0.1.0-experimental package through the Unity Package Manager Registry. See the MLAPI install guide for details.
* Updated the user interface including the following:

  * When joining a game, a "Connecting..." UI loads. When disconnecting from a game, you are returned to the MainMenuScene with a "Connection to Host lost" message. If the game fails to connect, a general message "Connection to Host failed" loads. <!-- GOMPS-5, GOMPS-114 -->
  * Added an option to leave the lobby after joining it. You no longer have to restart the game to leave the lobby. <!-- GOMPS-375 -->
  * Added option to cancel my selection after clicking **Ready**. <!-- GOMPS-293 -->
  * Added a gear icon for accessing and modifying app settings. <!-- GOMPS-421 -->
  * The UI now tracks and displays player has arrived, number of connected players in the lobby, and player status. <!-- GOMPS-292 GOMPS-351 -->

This release includes the following updates:

* Updated Boss Room per asset and project settings for increased performance and better resource management: <!-- GOMPS-539-->

* Reviewed and revised code to better following quality standards. <!-- GOMPS-203, GOMPS-218, GOMPS-223 -->
* Updated the Mage character base attack to better support the new enqueuing ability and handle game behaviors. Updates include:<!-- https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.samples.coop/pull/60 GOMPS-228 GOMPS-379 GOMPS-417 -->

  * Actions being non-blocking now allow other actions while a mage-bolt is in flight
  * Actions send in `ActionSequence` groups to better handle actions when players spam click enemies
  * Timing issues with animations, actions, and character location
  * Bolt animation for legitimate hits
  * Updated attacks not to knock rogues out of stealth <!-- GOMPS-423 -->

* Updated character attacks to not cause friendly-fire damage between players. <!-- GOMPS-299 -->

  * Removed the `ButtonID` from `UIHudButton`.
  * Removed hard-coded values from `HeroActionBar`.
  * Removed switch statements.
  * Completed minor code cleanup.
  * Added verification to only show skill and ability buttons for available character abilities. Empty buttons no longer load for characters. <!-- GOMPS-356 -->

* Added a call to warm up shaders when the project starts to ensure animations issues do not occur. <!-- GOMPS-367 -->
* Removed collision from objects that have a Broken (dead) state. <!-- GOMPS-461 -->

## Known issues

The following issues may occur for access and games:

* An MLAPI soft sync error on cleanup between scene transitions may break the game, for example imps do not spawn and pots are intangible.  <!-- GOMPS-535, MTT-772-->
* The game can be initiated while a second player is connecting to the host in `CharSelect`. Players may join without selected characters spawning and in an unresponsive state.<!-- GOMPS-534 -->
* Sometimes after completing a match and the host starts a new match from the Victory or Loss screen, connected players may have no visible interactions to join or select characters. A work-around is implemented to not block entry into the game. <!-- GOMPS-464 GOMPS-506 still an issue -->
* Sometimes the client may be disconnected from Photon which causes a timeout and `PhotonRealtimeTransport` to be in a bad state after the shutdown. An exception is developed that fires every frame. <!-- GOMPS-525 GOMPS-532 MLAPI GH 70 -->
