## New features

This release provides the following new features and APIs:

* Snapshot features are in-progress for Unity MLAPI. Additional information will be provided during development. <!-- MTT-591 -->
* Additional Profiler features are in-progress for performance network profiling. Additional information will be provided during development. <!-- MTT-716 -->

### New APIs

The following APIs have been added:

* The following APIs support Profiler features:

  * `MLAPI.Profiling.ProfilerNotifier`
  * `MLAPI.Profiling.ProfilerNotifier.NoTickDataHandler`
  * `MLAPI.Profiling.ProfilerNotifier.PerformanceDataEventHandler`

* The following APIs provide a simplified method of notifying when all clients have loaded to a new scene and are ready. The `NetworkSceneManager` captures events and provides that data without needing to re-subscribe. <!-- MTT-588 PR 755 -->

  * `MLAPI.SceneManagement.NetworkSceneManager.NotifyClientAllClientsLoadedSceneDelegate`
  * `MLAPI.SceneManagement.NetworkSceneManager.NotifyServerAllClientsLoadedSceneDelegate`
  * `MLAPI.SceneManagement.NetworkSceneManager.NotifyServerClientLoadedSceneDelegate`

* `MLAPI.SnapshotSystem` added for snapshot features.
* The following APIs were created in refactoring custom spawn and destroy handlers for `NetworkSpawnManager` and usage of `UnityEditor.GlobalObjectID`. Custom spawn and destroy functionality is not affected, a server can still spawn a specific prefab and a different, predetermined prefab in its place on a client.  <!-- MTT-622 -->

  * `MLAPI.Spawning.INetworkPrefabInstanceHandler`
  * `MLAPI.Spawning.NetworkPrefabHandler`

## Changes

This release includes the following updates:

* NetworkPrefabs updated to use `GlobalObjectIdHash` (internal Unity value) to best identify and link NetworkPrefabs  in the project attached to `NetworkManager` between server and clients. The usage of `GlobalObjectId` including the following changes: <!-- MTT-611 MTT-610 MTT-612 -->

  * `NetworkInstanceId` was removed in favor of `GlobalObjectIdHash`, which is not exposed to public APIs. `GlobalObjectIdHash` is meant for MLAPI framework internals (specifically NetworkObject and NetworkPrefab linking layer) and is not intended for users.
  * When a NetworkPrefab is registered with `NetworkManager`, it can be spawned dynamically on the network at runtime. The server assigns a unique ID, and replicates it to connected clients for synchronization. This removes the need for `UsePrefabSync` (removed).
  * Custom spawn and destroy APIs were refactored without affecting functionality.

* Completed code maintenance and updates to better support testing. <!-- MTT-601 determine how much should be documented in this ticket "internal work" -->

### Removed APIs

The following APIs have been removed due to refactoring:

* `MLAPI.Configuration.NetworkPrefab`
* `MLAPI.NetworkManager.PerformanceDataEventHandler`
* `MLAPI.Profiling.Sample` 
* `MLAPI.Spawning.NetworkSpawnManager.DestroyHandlerDelegate`
* `MLAPI.Spawning.NetworkSpawnManager.SpawnHandlerDelegate`
* `UsePrefabSync`, `PrefabHash`, and `PrefabHashGenerator`
* `NetworkInstanceId` and `NetworkScenePostProcessor`

## Fixes

This release includes the following issue fixes:

* [GitHub 367](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.mlapi/pull/367): `OnClientConnectedCallback` is now properly called when `StartHost` is called. This affects `NetworkManager` `OnClientConnectedCallback` and `ConnectionApproval` `ConnectionApprovalCallback`. <!-- MTT-566 -->
* [GitHub 664](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.mlapi/issues/664): Updates the `drawElementCallback` to assure there is only one default player prefab. This resolves an issue where adding a new Prefab in **NetworkPrefabs** automatically marked it as default. <!-- MTT-537 -->
* [GitHub 803](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.mlapi/pull/803) : Switched from `ModuleDefinition.Types` to `ModuleDefinition.GetTypes()` API. `NetworkBehaviourILPP` now iterates over all types and filters for `NetworkBehaviour` derived types and leaving no one outside from ILPP.
