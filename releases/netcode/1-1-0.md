## NGO [1.1.0] - 2022-10-20

### Added

* Added `NetworkManager.IsApproved` flag that is set to `true` if a client is approved. ([#2261](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.netcode.gameobjects/pull/2261))
* `UnityTransport` now provides a way to set the [Relay server](https://docs.unity.com/relay/relay-servers.html) data directly from the `RelayServerData` structure (provided by the Unity Transport package) through its `SetRelayServerData` method. This allows you to use the new APIs in UTP 1.3 that simplify integrating the [Relay SDK](https://docs.unity.com/relay/SDK/sdk.html). ([#2235](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.netcode.gameobjects/pull/2235))
* Added IPv6 support for direct connections when using `UnityTransport`. ([#2232](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.netcode.gameobjects/pull/2232))
* Added WebSocket support when using UTP 2.0 with the `UseWebSockets` property in the `UnityTransport` component of the `NetworkManager`. This allows you to pick WebSockets for communication. If you’re building for WebGL, NGO uses WebSockets automatically. ([#2201](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.netcode.gameobjects/pull/2201))
* Added position, rotation, and scale to the `ParentSyncMessage`. This allows users to specify the final values on the server side when invoking `OnNetworkObjectParentChanged` just before creating the message (when the `Transform` values are applied to the message). ([#2146](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.netcode.gameobjects/pull/2146))
* Added the `NetworkObject.TryRemoveParent` convenience method. You can now use this method instead of casting null to `GameObject` or `NetworkObject`. ([#2146](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.netcode.gameobjects/pull/2146))

### Changed

* Updated `UnityTransport` dependency on `com.unity.transport` to 1.3.0. ([#2231](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.netcode.gameobjects/pull/2231))
* Made the send queues of `UnityTransport` dynamically sized. This means that you shouldn't need to tweak the **Max Send Queue Size** value. In fact, this field is no longer available in the Inspector (and won’t be serialized anymore). While not recommended in most cases, you can still set the value manually using the `MaxSendQueueSize` property for special cases, such as limiting the amount of memory used by the send queues in constrained environments. ([#2212](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.netcode.gameobjects/pull/2212))
* As a consequence of the above change, the `UnityTransport.InitialMaxSendQueueSize` field is now deprecated. There is no default value anymore since send queues are dynamically-sized. ([#2212](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.netcode.gameobjects/pull/2212))
* Made the debug simulator in `UnityTransport` non-deterministic. Before this change, its random number generator was seeded with a constant value, which lead to the same pattern of packet drops, delays, and jitter in every run. ([#2196](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.netcode.gameobjects/pull/2196))
* Added support for managed `INetworkSerializable` types to `NetworkVariable&lt;>`. It also supports other managed types with serialization and deserialization delegates registered to `UserNetworkVariableSerialization&lt;T>.WriteValue` and `UserNetworkVariableSerialization&lt;T>.ReadValue` ([#2219](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.netcode.gameobjects/pull/2219))
* `NetworkVariable&lt;>` and `BufferSerializer&lt;BufferSerializerReader>` now deserialize `INetworkSerializable` types in-place, rather than constructing new ones. ([#2219](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.netcode.gameobjects/pull/2219))

### Fixed

* Fixed `NetworkManager.ApprovalTimeout` so that it won't timeout due to slower client synchronization times. It now uses the added `NetworkManager.IsApproved` flag to determine if the client has been approved or not. ([#2261](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.netcode.gameobjects/pull/2261))
* Fixed an issue caused by changing ownership of objects hidden from some clients. ([#2242](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.netcode.gameobjects/issues/2242))
* Fixed an issue where an in-scene placed NetworkObject would not invoke `NetworkBehaviour.OnNetworkSpawn` if the GameObject was disabled when it despawned. ([#2239](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.netcode.gameobjects/pull/2239))
* Fixed an issue where clients were not rebuilding the `NetworkConfig` hash value for each unique connection request. ([#2226](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.netcode.gameobjects/pull/2226))
* Fixed an issue where player objects were not taking the `DontDestroyWithOwner` property into consideration when a client disconnected. ([#2225](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.netcode.gameobjects/pull/2225))
* Fixed an issue where `SceneEventProgress` would not complete if a client joins late while it's still in progress. ([#2222](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.netcode.gameobjects/pull/2222))
* Fixed an issue where `SceneEventProgress` would not complete if a client disconnects. ([#2222](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.netcode.gameobjects/pull/2222))
* Fixed issues with detecting if a `SceneEventProgress` has timed out. ([#2222](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.netcode.gameobjects/pull/2222))
* Fixed issue [#1924](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.netcode.gameobjects/issues/1924) where `UnityTransport` would fail to restart after a first failure (even if what caused the initial failure was addressed). ([#2220](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.netcode.gameobjects/pull/2220))
* Fixed an issue where `NetworkTransform.SetStateServerRpc` and `NetworkTransform.SetStateClientRpc` were not honoring local vs world space settings when applying the position and rotation. ([#2203](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.netcode.gameobjects/pull/2203))
* Fixed ILPP `TypeLoadException` on WebGL on MacOS Editor and potentially other platforms. ([#2199](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.netcode.gameobjects/pull/2199))
* Fixed an issue with implicit conversion of `NetworkObjectReference` to GameObject. It now returns null instead of throwing an exception if the referenced object can't be found (that is, it was already despawned). ([#2158](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.netcode.gameobjects/pull/2158))
* Fixed a warning resulting from a stray `NetworkAnimator.meta` file. ([#2153](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.netcode.gameobjects/pull/2153))
* Fixed an issue with Connection Approval Timeout not working client side. ([#2164](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.netcode.gameobjects/pull/2164))
* Fixed an issue where the `WorldPositionStays` parenting parameter wasn't synchronizing with clients. ([#2146](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.netcode.gameobjects/pull/2146))
* Fixed an issue where parented in-scene placed `NetworkObject`s would fail for late joining clients. ([#2146](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.netcode.gameobjects/pull/2146))
* Fixed an issue where the scale wasn't being synchronized, which caused issues with nested parenting and scale when `WorldPositionStays` was true. ([#2146](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.netcode.gameobjects/pull/2146))
* Fixed an issue with `NetworkTransform.ApplyTransformToNetworkStateWithInfo` where it wasn't honoring axis sync settings when `NetworkTransformState.IsTeleportingNextFrame` was true. ([#2146](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.netcode.gameobjects/pull/2146))
* Fixed an issue with `NetworkTransform.TryCommitTransformToServer` where it wasn't honoring the `InLocalSpace` setting. ([#2146](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.netcode.gameobjects/pull/2146))
* Fixed an issue with `ClientRpcs` always reporting in the profiler view as going to all clients, even when limited to a subset of clients by `ClientRpcParams`. ([#2144](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.netcode.gameobjects/pull/2144))
* Fixed an issue with RPC code generation (codegen) failing to choose the correct extension methods for `FastBufferReader` and `FastBufferWriter` when the parameters were a generic type (that is, `List`) and extensions for multiple instantiations of that type have been defined (that is, `List` and `List`). ([#2142](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.netcode.gameobjects/pull/2142))
* Fixed the issue where running a server (not a host) causes the second player to not receive updates (unless a third player joined). ([#2127](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.netcode.gameobjects/pull/2127))
* Fixed an issue where late-joining client transition synchronization can fail when more than one transition occurred. ([#2127](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.netcode.gameobjects/pull/2127))
* Fixed an issue that was throwing an exception in `OnNetworkUpdate`, causing other `OnNetworkUpdate` calls to not be executed. ([#1739](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.netcode.gameobjects/pull/1739))
* Fixed a synchronization issue that occurs when `Time.timeScale` is set to 0. This changes the timing update to use unscaled delta-time. Now network update rates are independent of the local time scale. ([#2171](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.netcode.gameobjects/issues/2171))
* Fixed an issue where not all `NetworkVariables` were sent to all clients when a client connects to a server. ([#1987](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.netcode.gameobjects/issues/1987))
* Fixed an issue with `IsOwner`/`IsOwnedByServer` being wrong on the server after calling `RemoveOwnership`. ([#2211](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.netcode.gameobjects/pull/2211))
