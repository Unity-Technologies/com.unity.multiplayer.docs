## [1.0.2] - 2022-09-13

### Fixed

* Fixed issue where `NetworkTransform` was not honoring the `InLocalSpace` property on the authority side during `OnNetworkSpawn`. ([#2170](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.netcode.gameobjects/pull/2170))
* Fixed issue where `NetworkTransform` was not ending extrapolation for the previous state causing non-authoritative instances to become out of sync. ([#2170](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.netcode.gameobjects/pull/2170))
* Fixed issue where `NetworkTransform` was not continuing to interpolate for the remainder of the associated tick period. ([#2170](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.netcode.gameobjects/pull/2170))
* Fixed issue during `NetworkTransform.OnNetworkSpawn` for non-authoritative instances where it was initializing interpolators with the replicated network state, which now only contains the transform deltas that occurred during a network tick and not the entire transform state. ([#2170](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.netcode.gameobjects/pull/2170))

## [1.0.1] - 2022-08-25

* Changed version to 1.0.1. ([#2131](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.netcode.gameobjects/pull/2131))
* Updated dependency on `com.unity.transport` to 1.2.0. ([#2129](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.netcode.gameobjects/pull/2129))
* When using `UnityTransport`, _reliable_ payloads can now exceed the configured `Max Payload Size`. Unreliable payloads remain bounded by this setting. ([#2081](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.netcode.gameobjects/pull/2081))
* Added performance improvements for cases with many `NetworkObjects` by not iterating over all unchanged `NetworkObjects`.


### Fixed



* Fixed an issue where not sending all `NetworkVariables` to all clients when a client connects to a server. ([#1987](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.netcode.gameobjects/issues/1987))
* Fixed an issue where reading/writing more than 8 bits at a time with BitReader/BitWriter would write/read from the wrong place, returning an incorrect result. ([#2130](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.netcode.gameobjects/pull/2130))
* Fixed an issue with the internal `NetworkTransformState.m_Bitset` flag not getting cleared upon the next tick advancement. ([#2110](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.netcode.gameobjects/pull/2110))
* Fixed an interpolation issue with `NetworkTransform.Teleport`. ([#2110](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.netcode.gameobjects/pull/2110))
* Fixed an issue where the authoritative side was interpolating its transform. ([#2110](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.netcode.gameobjects/pull/2110))
* Fixed an issue where Owner-written `NetworkVariable` infinitely writes to themselves. ([#2109](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.netcode.gameobjects/issues/2109))
* Fixed an issue where `NetworkList` showed when inserting at the end of a `NetworkList`. ([#2099](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.netcode.gameobjects/pull/2099))
* Fixed an issue where a client owner of a `NetworkVariable` with both owners' read and write permissions would not update the server side when changed. ([#2097](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.netcode.gameobjects/pull/2097))
* Fixed an issue where attempting to spawn a parent `GameObject` with a `NetworkObject` component attached (that has one or more inactive child `GameObjects`), that are inactive in the hierarchy. Now, with `NetworkBehaviour` components it will no longer attempt to spawn the associated `NetworkBehaviour`(s) or invoke ownership changed notifications but will log a warning message. ([#2096](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.netcode.gameobjects/pull/2096))
* Fixed an issue where destroying a `NetworkBehaviour` would not deregister it from the parent `NetworkObject`, leading to exceptions when the parent was later destroyed. ([#2091](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.netcode.gameobjects/pull/2091))
* Fixed an issue where `NetworkObject.NetworkHide` was despawning and destroying, as opposed to only despawning, in-scene placed `NetworkObjects`. ([#2086](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.netcode.gameobjects/pull/2086))
* Fixed an issue where `NetworkAnimator` synchronized transitions twice due to detecting the change in animation state once a trigger starts a transition. ([#2084](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.netcode.gameobjects/pull/2084))
* Fixed an issue where `NetworkAnimator` would not synchronize a looping animation for late joining clients if it was at the very end of its loop. ([#2076](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.netcode.gameobjects/pull/2076))
* Fixed issue where `NetworkAnimator` was not removing its subscription from `OnClientConnectedCallback` when despawned during the shutdown sequence. ([#2074](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.netcode.gameobjects/pull/2074))
* Fixed an issue where `IsServer` and `IsClient` are set to false before the object despawns during the shutdown sequence. ([#2074](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.netcode.gameobjects/pull/2074))
* Fixed an issue with the `NetworkList Value` event on the server. `PreviousValue` is now set correctly when a new value is set through the property setter. ([#2067](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.netcode.gameobjects/pull/2067))
* Fixed an issue where `NetworkLists` is not populating on the client. `NetworkList`. It now uses the most recent list instead of the list at the end of the previous frame when sending full updates to a dynamically spawned `NetworkObject`. The difference in behavior is required because scene management spawns those objects at a different time in the frame, relative to updates. ([#2062](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.netcode.gameobjects/issues/2062))


## [1.0.0] - 2022-06-27

- Changed version to 1.0.0. (#2046)

## [1.0.0-pre.10] - 2022-06-21

### Added

- Added a new `OnTransportFailure` callback to `NetworkManager`. This callback is invoked when the manager's `NetworkTransport` encounters an unrecoverable error. Transport failures also cause the `NetworkManager` to shut down. Currently, this is only used by `UnityTransport` to signal a timeout of its connection to the Unity Relay servers. (#1994)
- Added `NetworkEvent.TransportFailure`, which can be used by implementations of `NetworkTransport` to signal to `NetworkManager` that an unrecoverable error was encountered. (#1994)
- Added test to ensure a warning occurs when nesting NetworkObjects in a NetworkPrefab (#1969)
- Added `NetworkManager.RemoveNetworkPrefab(...)` to remove a prefab from the prefabs list (#1950)

### Changed

- Updated `UnityTransport` dependency on `com.unity.transport` to 1.1.0. (#2025)
- (API Breaking) `ConnectionApprovalCallback` is no longer an `event` and will not allow more than 1 handler registered at a time. Also, `ConnectionApprovalCallback` is now a `Func<>` taking `ConnectionApprovalRequest` in and returning `ConnectionApprovalResponse` back out (#1972)

### Fixed

- Fixed issue where dynamically spawned `NetworkObject`s could throw an exception if the scene of origin handle was zero (0) and the `NetworkObject` was already spawned. (#2017)
- Fixed issue where `NetworkObject.Observers` was not being cleared when despawned. (#2009)
- Fixed `NetworkAnimator` could not run in the server authoritative mode. (#2003)
- Fixed issue where late joining clients would get a soft synchronization error if any in-scene placed NetworkObjects were parented under another `NetworkObject`. (#1985)
- Fixed issue where `NetworkBehaviourReference` would throw a type cast exception if using `NetworkBehaviourReference.TryGet` and the component type was not found. (#1984)
- Fixed `NetworkSceneManager` was not sending scene event notifications for the currently active scene and any additively loaded scenes when loading a new scene in `LoadSceneMode.Single` mode. (#1975)
- Fixed issue where one or more clients disconnecting during a scene event would cause `LoadEventCompleted` or `UnloadEventCompleted` to wait until the `NetworkConfig.LoadSceneTimeOut` period before being triggered. (#1973)
- Fixed issues when multiple `ConnectionApprovalCallback`s were registered (#1972)
- Fixed a regression in serialization support: `FixedString`, `Vector2Int`, and `Vector3Int` types can now be used in NetworkVariables and RPCs again without requiring a `ForceNetworkSerializeByMemcpy<>` wrapper. (#1961)
- Fixed generic types that inherit from NetworkBehaviour causing crashes at compile time. (#1976)
- Fixed endless dialog boxes when adding a `NetworkBehaviour` to a `NetworkManager` or vice-versa. (#1947)
- Fixed `NetworkAnimator` issue where it was only synchronizing parameters if the layer or state changed or was transitioning between states. (#1946)
- Fixed `NetworkAnimator` issue where when it did detect a parameter had changed it would send all parameters as opposed to only the parameters that changed. (#1946)
- Fixed `NetworkAnimator` issue where it was not always disposing the `NativeArray` that is allocated when spawned. (#1946)
- Fixed `NetworkAnimator` issue where it was not taking the animation speed or state speed multiplier into consideration. (#1946)
- Fixed `NetworkAnimator` issue where it was not properly synchronizing late joining clients if they joined while `Animator` was transitioning between states. (#1946)
- Fixed `NetworkAnimator` issue where the server was not relaying changes to non-owner clients when a client was the owner. (#1946)
- Fixed issue where the `PacketLoss` metric for tools would return the packet loss over a connection lifetime instead of a single frame. (#2004)

## [1.0.0-pre.9] - 2022-05-10

### Fixed

- Fixed Hosting again after failing to host now works correctly (#1938)
- Fixed NetworkManager to cleanup connected client lists after stopping (#1945)
- Fixed NetworkHide followed by NetworkShow on the same frame works correctly (#1940)

## [1.0.0-pre.8] - 2022-04-27

### Changed

- `unmanaged` structs are no longer universally accepted as RPC parameters because some structs (i.e., structs with pointers in them, such as `NativeList<T>`) can't be supported by the default memcpy struct serializer. Structs that are intended to be serialized across the network must add `INetworkSerializeByMemcpy` to the interface list (i.e., `struct Foo : INetworkSerializeByMemcpy`). This interface is empty and just serves to mark the struct as compatible with memcpy serialization. For external structs you can't edit, you can pass them to RPCs by wrapping them in `ForceNetworkSerializeByMemcpy<T>`. (#1901)
- Changed requirement to register in-scene placed NetworkObjects with `NetworkManager` in order to respawn them.  In-scene placed NetworkObjects are now automatically tracked during runtime and no longer need to be registered as a NetworkPrefab.  (#1898)

### Removed

- Removed `SIPTransport` (#1870)
- Removed `ClientNetworkTransform` from the package samples and moved to Boss Room's Utilities package which can be found [here](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.samples.coop/blob/main/Packages/com.unity.multiplayer.samples.coop/Utilities/Net/ClientAuthority/ClientNetworkTransform.cs) (#1912)

### Fixed

- Fixed issue where `NetworkSceneManager` did not synchronize despawned in-scene placed NetworkObjects. (#1898)
- Fixed `NetworkTransform` generating false positive rotation delta checks when rolling over between 0 and 360 degrees. (#1890)
- Fixed client throwing an exception if it has messages in the outbound queue when processing the `NetworkEvent.Disconnect` event and is using UTP. (#1884)
- Fixed issue during client synchronization if 'ValidateSceneBeforeLoading' returned false it would halt the client synchronization process resulting in a client that was approved but not synchronized or fully connected with the server. (#1883)
- Fixed an issue where UNetTransport.StartServer would return success even if the underlying transport failed to start (#854)
- Passing generic types to RPCs no longer causes a native crash (#1901)
- Fixed a compile failure when compiling against com.unity.nuget.mono-cecil >= 1.11.4 (#1920)
- Fixed an issue where calling `Shutdown` on a `NetworkManager` that was already shut down would cause an immediate shutdown the next time it was started (basically the fix makes `Shutdown` idempotent). (#1877)

## [1.0.0-pre.7] - 2022-04-06

### Added

- Added editor only check prior to entering into play mode if the currently open and active scene is in the build list and if not displays a dialog box asking the user if they would like to automatically add it prior to entering into play mode. (#1828)

### Fixed
- Fixed in-scene placed NetworkObjects not being found/ignored after a client disconnects and then reconnects. (#1850)
- Fixed issue where `UnityTransport` send queues were not flushed when calling `DisconnectLocalClient` or `DisconnectRemoteClient`. (#1847)
- Fixed NetworkBehaviour dependency verification check for an existing NetworkObject not searching from root parent transform relative GameObject. (#1841)
- Fixed issue where entries were not being removed from the NetworkSpawnManager.OwnershipToObjectsTable. (#1838)
- Fixed ClientRpcs would always send to all connected clients by default as opposed to only sending to the NetworkObject's Observers list by default. (#1836)
- Fixed clarity for NetworkSceneManager client side notification when it receives a scene hash value that does not exist in its local hash table. (#1828)
- Fixed client throws a key not found exception when it times out using UNet or UTP. (#1821)
- Fixed network variable updates are no longer limited to 32,768 bytes when NetworkConfig.EnsureNetworkVariableLengthSafety is enabled. The limits are now determined by what the transport can send in a message. (#1811)
- Fixed in-scene NetworkObjects get destroyed if a client fails to connect and shuts down the NetworkManager. (#1809)
- Fixed user never being notified in the editor that a NetworkBehaviour requires a NetworkObject to function properly. (#1808)
- Fixed PlayerObjects and dynamically spawned NetworkObjects not being added to the NetworkClient's OwnedObjects (#1801)

## [1.0.0-pre.6] - 2022-03-02

### Added
- NetworkAnimator now properly synchrhonizes all animation layers as well as runtime-adjusted weighting between them (#1765)
- Added first set of tests for NetworkAnimator - parameter syncing, trigger set / reset, override network animator (#1735)

### Changed

### Fixed
- Fixed an issue where sometimes the first client to connect to the server could see messages from the server as coming from itself. (#1683)
- Fixed an issue where clients seemed to be able to send messages to ClientId 1, but these messages would actually still go to the server (id 0) instead of that client. (#1683)
- Improved clarity of error messaging when a client attempts to send a message to a destination other than the server, which isn't allowed. (#1683)
- Disallowed async keyword in RPCs (#1681)
- Fixed an issue where Alpha release versions of Unity (version 2022.2.0a5 and later) will not compile due to the UNet Transport no longer existing (#1678)
- Fixed messages larger than 64k being written with incorrectly truncated message size in header (#1686) (credit: @kaen)

- Fixed NetworkList to properly call INetworkSerializable's NetworkSerialize() method (#1682)
- Fixed NetworkVariables containing more than 1300 bytes of data (such as large NetworkLists) no longer cause an OverflowException (the limit on data size is now whatever limit the chosen transport imposes on fragmented NetworkDelivery mechanisms) (#1725)
- Fixed ServerRpcParams and ClientRpcParams must be the last parameter of an RPC in order to function properly. Added a compile-time check to ensure this is the case and trigger an error if they're placed elsewhere (#1721)
- Fixed FastBufferReader being created with a length of 1 if provided an input of length 0 (#1724)
- Fixed The NetworkConfig's checksum hash includes the NetworkTick so that clients with a different tickrate than the server are identified and not allowed to connect (#1728)
- Fixed OwnedObjects not being properly modified when using ChangeOwnership (#1731)
- Improved performance in NetworkAnimator (#1735)
- Removed the "always sync" network animator (aka "autosend") parameters (#1746)

## [1.0.0-pre.5] - 2022-01-28

### Added

- Added `PreviousValue` in `NetworkListEvent`, when `Value` has changed (#1528)

### Changed

- Fixed an issue where if you are running as a server (not host) the LoadEventCompleted and UnloadEventCompleted events would fire early by the NetworkSceneManager [#1379](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.netcode.gameobjects/pull/1379)
- Fixed NetworkObjects not being despawned before they are destroyed during shutdown for client, host, and server instances. [#1390](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.netcode.gameobjects/pull/1390)
- Fixed KeyNotFound exception when removing ownership of a newly spawned NetworkObject that is already owned by the server. [#1500](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.netcode.gameobjects/pull/1500)
