The [Unity Transport](../../transport/0.8.0/introduction) `com.unity.transport` package respository adds multiplayer and network features to your project. See the following changelog for new features, updates, fixes, and upgrade information.

## [0.8.0] - 2021-03-23

### New features
* Added overloads of `PopEvent` and `PopEventForConnection` which return the pipeline used as an out parameter.

### Fixes
* Fixed some compatility issues with tiny.
* Fixed a crash when sending messages slightly less than one MTU using the fragmentation pipeline.
* Fixed a bug causing `NetworkDriver.RemoteEndPoint` to return an invalid value when using the default network interface.

## [0.7.0] - 2021-02-05

### New features
* Added `DataStreamWriter.WriteRawbits` and `DataStreamWriter.ReadRawBits` for reading and writing raw bits from a data stream.

### Changes
* Optimized the `NetworkCompressionModel` to find buckets in constant time.
* Changed the error behavior of `DataStreamReader` to be consistent between the editor and players.

### Fixes
* Fixed a crash when receiving a packet with an invalid pipeline identifier.

## [0.6.0] - 2020-11-26

### New features
* An error handling pass has been made and `Error.StatusCode` have been added to indicate more specific errors.
* `Error.DisconnectReason` has been added, so when NetworkDriver.PopEvent returns a `NetworkEvent.Type.Disconnect` the reader returned contains 1 byte of data indicating the reason.

### Changes
* The function signature for NetworkDriver.BeginSend has changed. It now returns an `int` value indicating if the function succeeded or not and the DataStreamWriter now instead is returned as a `out` parameter.
* The function signature for INetworkInterface.Initialize has changed. It now requires you to return an `int` value indicating if the function succeeded or not.
* The function signature for INetworkInterface.CreateInterfaceEndPoint has changed. It now requires you to return an `int` value indicating if the function succeeded or not, and NetworkInterfaceEndPoint is now returned as a `out` parameter.

### Fixes
* Fixed a potential crash when receiving a malformated packet.
* Fixed an issue where the DataStream could sometimes fail writing packet uints before the buffer was full.

### Upgrade guide
* `NetworkDriver.BeginSend` now returns an `int` indicating a `Error.StatusCode`, and the `DataStreamWriter` is passed as an `out` parameter.

## [0.5.0] - 2020-10-01

### Fixes
* Fixed display of ipv6 addresses as strings

## [0.4.1] - 2020-09-10
### New features
* Added `NetworkDriver.GetEventQueueSizeForConnection` which allows you to check how many pending events a connection has.

### Changes
### Fixes
* Fixed a compatibility isue with DOTS Runtime.

## [0.4.0-preview.3] - 2020-08-21

### New features
* Added a new fragmentation pipeline which allows you to send messages larger than one MTU. If the `FragmentationPipelineStage` is part of the pipeline you are trying to send with the `NetworkDriver` will allow a `requiredPayloadSize` larger than one MTU to be specified and split the message into multiple packages.

### Changes
* The methods to read and write strings in the `DataStreamReader`/`DataStreamWriter` have been changed to use `FixedString<N>` instead of `NativeString<N>`. The name of the methods have also changed from `ReadString` to `ReadFixedString64` - and similar changes for write and the packed version of the calls. The calls support `FixedString32`, `FixedString64`, `FixedString128`, `FixedString512` and `FixedString4096`.
* Minimum required Unity version has changed to 2020.1.2.

### Upgrade guide
The data stream methods for reading and writing strings have changed, they now take `FixedString64` instead of `NativeString64` and the names have changed as follows:

* `DataStreamReader.ReadString` -> `DataStreamReader.ReadFixedString64`
* `DataStreamReader.ReadPackedStringDelta` -> `DataStreamReader.ReadPackedFixedString64Delta`
* `DataStreamWriter.WriteString` -> `DataStreamWriter.WriteFixedString64`
* `DataStreamWriter.WritePackedStringDelta` -> `DataStreamWriter.WritePackedFixedString64Delta`

The transport now requires Unity 2020.1.2.

## [0.3.1-preview.4] - 2020-06-05

### Changes
* Added a new `requiredPayloadSize` parameter to `BeginSend`. The required size cannot be larger than `NetworkParameterConstants.MTU`.
* Added errorcode parameter to a `network_set_nonblocking`, `network_set_send_buffer_size` and `network_set_receive_buffer_size` in `NativeBindings`.
* Additional APIs added to `NativeBindings`: `network_set_blocking`, `network_get_send_buffer_size`, `network_get_receive_buffer_size`, `network_set_receive_timeout`, `network_set_send_timeout`.
* Implemented `NetworkEndPoint.AddressAsString`.

### Fixes
* Fixed an issue in the reliable pipeline which would cause it to not recover if one end did not receive packages for a while.
* Fixed `NetworkInterfaceEndPoint` and `NetworkEndPoint` `GetHashCode` implementation.
* Fixed invalid use of strings when specifying the size of socket buffers in the native bindings.

## [0.3.0-preview.6] - 2020-02-24

### Changes
* Pipelines are now registered by calling `NetworkPipelineStageCollection.RegisterPipelineStage` before creating a `NetworkDriver`. The built-in pipelines do not require explicit registration. The interface for implementing pipelines has been changed to support this.
* NetworkDriver is no longer a generic type. You pass it an interface when creating the `NetworkDriver`, which means you can switch between backends without modifying all usage of the driver. There is a new `NetworkDriver.Create` which creates a driver with the default `NetworkInterface`. It is also possible to create a `new NetworkDriver` by passing a `NetworkInterface` instance as the first argument.
* `NetworkDriver.Send` is replaced by `BeginSend` and `EndSend`. This allows us to do less data copying when sending messages. The interface for implementing new network interfaces has been changed to support this.
* `DataStreamReader` and `DataStreamWriter` no longer owns any memory. They are just reading/writing the data of a `NativeArray<byte>`.
* `DataStreamWriter` has explicit types for all Write methods.
* `DataStreamReader.Context` has been removed.
* Error handling for `DataStreamWriter` has been improved, on failure it returns false and sets `DataStreamWriter.HasFailedWrites` to true. `DataStreamReader` returns a default value and sets `DataStreamReader.HasFailedReads` to true. `DataStreamReader` will throw an exception instead of returning a default value in the editor.
* IPCManager is no longer public, it is still possible to create a `NetworkDriver` with a `IPCNetworkInterface`.
* Added `NetworkDriver.ScheduleFlushSend` which must be called to guarantee that messages are send before next call to `NetworkDriver.ScheduleUpdate`.
* Added `NetworkDriver.LastUpdateTime` to get the update time the `NetworkDriver` used for the most recent update.
* Removed the IPC address family, use a IPv4 localhost address instead.

### Fixes
* Fixed a memory overflow in the reliability pipeline.
* Made the soaker report locale independent.

### Upgrade guide
Creation and type of `NetworkDriver` has changed, use `NetworkDriver.Create` or pass an instance of a `NetworkInterface` to the `NetworkDriver` constructor.

`NetworkDriver.Send` has been replaced by a pair of `NetworkDriver.BeginSend` and `NetworkDriver.EndSend`. Calling `BeginSend` will return a `DataStreamWriter` to which you write the data. The `DataStreamWriter` is then passed to `EndSend`.

All write calls in `DataStreamWriter` need an explicit type, for example `Write(0)` should be replaced by `WriteInt(0)`.

`DataStreamWriter` no longer shares current position between copies, if you call a method which writes you must pass it by ref for the modifications to apply.

`DataStreamWriter` no longer returns a DeferedWriter, you need to take a copy of the writer at the point you want to make modifications and use the copy to overwrite data later.

`DataStreamWriter` is no longer disposable. If you use the allocating constructor you need to use `Allocator.Temp`, if you pass a `NativeArray<byte>` to the constructor the `NativeArray` owns the memory.

`DataStreamReader.Context` no longer exists, you need to pass the `DataStreamReader` itself by ref if you read in a different function.

The interface for network pipelines has been changed.

The interface for network interfaces has been changed.

## [0.2.3-preview.0] - 2019-12-12
### Changes
* Added reading and write methods for NativeString64 to DataStream.

## [0.2.2-preview.2] - 2019-12-05

### Changes
* Added a stress test for parallel sending of data.
* Upgraded collections to 0.3.0.

### Fixes
* Fixed a race condition in IPCNetworkInterface.
* Changed NetworkEventQueue to use UnsafeList to get some type safety.
* Fixed an out-of-bounds access in the reliable sequenced pipeline.
* Fixed spelling and broken links in the documentation.

## [0.2.1-preview.1] - 2019-11-28

### Fixes
* Added missing bindings for Linux and Android.

## [0.2.0-preview.4] - 2019-11-26

### Changes
* Added support for unquantized floats to `DataStream` class.
* Added `NetworkConfigParameter.maxFrameTimeMS` so you to allow longer frame times when debugging to prevent disconnections due to timeout.
* Allow "1.1.1.1:1234" strings when parsing the IP string in the NetworkEndPoint class, it will use the port part when it's present.
* Reliable pipeline now doesn't require parameters passed in (uses default window size of 32)
* Added Read/Write of ulong to `DataStream`.
* Made it possible to get connection state from the parallel NetworkDriver.
* Added `LengthInBits` to the `DataStreamWriter`.

### Fixes
* Do not push data events to disconnected connections. Fixes an error about resetting the queue with pending messages.
* Made the endian checks in `DataStream` compatible with latest version of burst.

## [0.1.2-preview.1] - 2019-07-17

### New features
* Added a new *Ping-Multiplay* sample based on the *Ping* sample.
    * Created to be the main sample for demonstrating Multiplay compatibility and best practices (SQP usage, IP binding, etc.).
    * Contains both client and server code. Additional details in readme in `/Assets/Samples/Ping-Multiplay/`.
* **DedicatedServerConfig**: Added arguments for `-fps` and `-timeout`.
* **NetworkEndPoint**: Added a `TryParse()` method which returns false if parsing fails
    * Note: The `Parse()` method returns a default IP / Endpoint if parsing fails, but a method that could report failure was needed for the Multiplay sample.
* **CommandLine**:
    * Added a `HasArgument()` method which returns true if an argument is present.
    * Added a `PrintArgsToLog()` method which is a simple way to print launch args to logs.
    * Added a `TryUpdateVariableWithArgValue()` method which updates a ref var only if an arg was found and successfully parsed.

### Changes
* Deleted existing SQP code and added reference to SQP Package (now in staging).
* Removed SQP server usage from basic *Ping* sample.
    * Note: The SQP server was only needed for Multiplay compatibility, so the addition of *Ping-Multiplay* allowed us to remove SQP from *Ping*.

### Fixes
* **DedicatedServerConfig**: Vsync is now disabled programmatically if requesting an FPS different from the current screen refresh rate.

## [0.1.1-preview.1] - 2019-06-05

### New features
* Moved MatchMaking to a package and supporting code to a separate folder.

### Fixes
* Fixed an issue with the reliable pipeline not resending when completely idle.

## [0.1.0-preview.1] - 2019-04-16

### New features
* Added network pipelines to enable processing of outgoing and incomming packets. The available pipeline stages are `ReliableSequencedPipelineStage` for reliable UDP messages and `SimulatorPipelineStage` for emulating network conditions such as high latency and packet loss. See the pipeline documentation for more information.
* Added reading and writing of packed signed and unsigned integers to `DataStream`. These new methods use huffman encoding to reduce the size of transfered data for small numbers.

### Changes
* Enable Burst compilation for most jobs.
* Made it possible to get the remote endpoint for a connection.
* Replacing EndPoint parsing with custom code to avoid having a dependency on `System.Net`.
* Change the ping sample command-line parameters for server to `-port` and `-query_port`.
* For matchmaking, use an Assignment object containing the `ConnectionString`, the `Roster`, and an `AssignmentError` string instead of just the `ConnectionString`.

### Fixes
* Fixed an issue with building iOS on Windows.
* Fixed inconsistent error handling between platforms when the network buffer is full.

### Upgrade guide
Unity 2019.1 is now required.

`BasicNetworkDriver` has been renamed to `GenericNetworkDriver` and a new `UdpNetworkDriver` helper class is also available.

`System.Net` EndPoints can no longer be used as addresses, use the new NetworkEndpoint struct instead.
