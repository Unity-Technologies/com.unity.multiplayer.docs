Welcome to the Unity Multiplayer Networking Documentation. This site includes the Netcode for GameObjects, Unity Transport, Boss Room Sample Co-op, Bitesize samples, and other tools and features.

The documentation site is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/) using [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

## Contributing Content

Always cut branches from **main** branch. 

See the [Contribution Guide](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.docs/wiki) to learn about writing and submitting content, our GitHub labels, and more. A [template file](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.docs/blob/master/docs/template.md) (/docs/template.md) is included in the repo to understand markdown formatting and options.

## Installation

You can install and build docs on Mac and Windows environments. The doc site is built on Docusaurus, which requires NodeJS and Yarn installed for your OS.

1. Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
1. Install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/).
1. Install Docusaurus to a temp location: `yarn global add docusaurus-init`. You can delete the temp project.

## Building on Local

For full building content, see [Building Locally](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.docs/wiki/Building-Locally):

1. Run the build command to generate a site. This command generates static content into the `build` directory.

    ```console
    yarn build
    ```

2. Start a local development server and open up a browser window with the following command. Most changes are hot-loaded, displaying without requiring a rebuild and restart.

    ```console
    yarn start
    ```

## Connect with Unity

## Tools Used

Our site uses [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) with Yarn commands. Always use Yarn commands, to update, build, and serve the server locally. Our search uses Algolia for Open Source.
