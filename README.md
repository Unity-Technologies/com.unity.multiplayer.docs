## Contributing Content

See the [Contribution Guide](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.docs/wiki) for details. A [template file](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.docs/blob/master/docs/template.md) (/docs/template.md) is included in the repo to understand markdown formatting and options.

## Installation

The first time you clone the repo, run the following command to install in the local cloned directory. You only need to run this once.

```console
yarn install
```

## Building on Local

For full building content, see [Building Locally](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.docs/wiki/Building-Locally):

1. Run the build command to generate a site. This command generates static content into the `build` directory.

    ```console
    yarn build
    ```

2. Start a local development server and open up a browser window with the following command. Most changes are hot-loaded, displaying without requiring a rebuild and restart.

    ```console
    yarn start
    ```

We recommend running `npm update` to update your local plugins and packages as needed.

## Connect with Unity 

Connect with the Unity Multitplayer team and community on the [MLAPI by Unity](http://discord.mlapi.network/) Discord using channel #documentation. You can also raise threads on the [Unity Multiplayer Forum](https://forum.unity.com/forums/multiplayer.26/)
