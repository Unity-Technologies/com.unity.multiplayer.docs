The Network Simulator tool allows you to test your multiplayer game in less-than-ideal network conditions, enabling you to discover issues in simulated real-world scenarios and fix them before they surface in production. It facilitates simulating [network events](#network-events), such as network [disconnects](#disconnects), [lag spikes](#lag-spikes), and [packet loss](#packet-loss).

The tool exposes configurable network parameters, such as packet delay and packet loss, that allow you to control the network conditions. It also bundles common configurations of those parameters together as [presets](#network-configuration-presets).

You can use the Network Simulator component to test different network conditions and create custom network scenarios. These utilities include:

* [Disabling the network connection](#disconnects)
* Triggering a [lag spike](#lag-spikes)
* Changing the current [configuration preset](#network-configuration-presets)

You can also use the Network Simulator SDK to create custom network scenarios that can automatically trigger network events (such as a lag spike) at specific frequencies and intervals. To help you get started, it includes several [example network scenarios](#use-a-network-scenario).

:::note
**Note**: All parameters exposed through the Network Simulator tool work with the Unity Transport Protocol (UTP) simulator pipeline stage.

The Random Connections Swap scenario selects one of configurations from the list at random at the **Change Interval** until you use the **Pause** button to pause the connection cycling.

### Network types

A network type is the general state of a user’s network connection. This section contains the descriptions of the available Network Simulator preset configurations. These configuration presets fall into five categories:

* [Home broadband connections](#home-broadband-connections)
* [Poor quality mobile connections](#poor-quality-mobile-connections)
* [Medium quality mobile connections](#medium-quality-mobile-connections)
* [Decent quality mobile connections](#decent-quality-mobile-connections)
* [Good quality mobile connections](#good-quality-mobile-connections)

#### Home broadband connections

A typical home broadband connection preset represents common connections from desktops, console platforms, and some mobile devices.

The [Home Broadband](#home-broadband) Network Simulator presets simulates a good-quality mobile connection

#### Poor-quality mobile connections

A poor-quality mobile connection preset represents an extremely poor connection, entirely unsuitable for synchronous multiplayer gaming due to exceptionally [high ping](#latency). However, it might work for some turn-based games.

The following Network Simulator presets simulate a poor-quality mobile connection:

* [Mobile 2G](#mobile-2g)
* [Mobile 2.5G](#mobile-25g)
* [Mobile 2.75G](#mobile-275g)
* [Mobile 3G](#mobile-3g)

#### Medium-quality mobile connections

A medium-quality mobile connection preset represents the minimum supported mobile connection for synchronous gameplay. Expect [high pings](#latency), [jitter](#jitter), stuttering, and [packet loss](#packet-loss).

The [Mobile 3.5G](#mobile-35g) Network Simulator presets simulates a medium-quality mobile connection.

#### Decent-quality mobile connections

A decent-quality mobile connection preset represents a suitable network for synchronous multiplayer. However, the [ping](#latency) and overall connection quality and stability might result in poor player experience due to [packet drops](#packet-loss). Players might drop all packets in bursts of one to 60 seconds, so you must ensure you handle reconnections.

The following Network Simulator presets simulate a poor quality mobile connection:

* [Mobile 3.75G](#mobile-375g)
* [Mobile 4G](#mobile-4g)
* [Mobile 4.5G](#mobile-45g)

#### Good quality mobile connections

A good quality mobile connection preset represents a mobile connection comparable to or better than a typical [home broadband connection](#home-broadband).

The [Mobile 5G](#mobile-5g) Network Simulator preset simulates a good-quality mobile connection

### Network events

The following sections cover common network connection events and problems you can simulate with the Network Simulator.

* [Disconnects](#disconnects)
* [Lag spikes](#lag-spikes)
* [Latency](#latency)
* [Packet loss](#packet-loss)
* [Jitter](#jitter)
* [Instability](#instability)

#### Disconnects

A network disconnect is a disruption or termination of the connection between the sender and the receiver.

You can trigger a network disconnect in the Unity Editor with the Network Simulator component by setting the **Connection** to **Disconnected**. See the [Disconnect scenario](#disconnect-scenario) example.

![](../static/img/tools/netsim-1.png)

#### Lag spikes

A lag spike refers to a temporary increase in network latency. Some of the most common causes of lag spikes include overburdened CPUs, temporary network disconnects, and unreliable connections with high [jitter](#jitter).

You can trigger a simulated lag spike in the Unity Editor with the Network Simulator component by setting the **Duration of the lag spike (ms)**, then selecting **Trigger**. See the [Lag spike scenario](#lag-spike-scenario) example.

![](../static/img/tools/netsim-7.png)

#### Latency

Network latency measures the time it takes a packet to travel across a network in milliseconds (ms). Players experience high latency (sometimes called “lag”) when the time delay between the server (or host) sending the information and the client receiving the information creates communication bottlenecks or an undesirable playing experience.

You can trigger control the simulated network latency in the Unity Editor with the Network Simulator component by setting the **Packet Delay (ms)** parameter.

:::note
**Note**: A common method of measuring the latency of a network connection is through ping messages. Pings are small network packets that you can use to measure the time it takes a packet to reach its destination in milliseconds. High ping often equates to high latency.
:::

#### Packet loss

Packet loss occurs when packets fail to reach their destination when transmitted across a network. It’s typically measured as a percentage of packets lost or the frequency of packets dropped.

You can trigger control the simulated packet loss in the Unity Editor with the Network Simulator component by setting the **Packet Loss Interval** and the **Packet Loss (%)** parameters.

#### Jitter

Jitter is the variation in packet delays ([latency](#latency)) measured in milliseconds (ms). High-quality network connections typically have reliable and consistent latency. However, poorer-quality network connections experience high variations in latency, which can create an inconsistent or poor experience for players. These high variations in latency can cause issues such as flickering displays, stuttering, further packet delays, and additional CPU usage.

You can trigger control the simulated network jitter in the Unity Editor with the Network Simulator component by setting the **Packet Jitter (ms)** parameter.

#### Instability

An unstable network connection might consist of intermittent network issues, such as network [disconnects](#disconnects), [packet loss](#packet-loss), [jitter](#jitter), and [latency](#latency).

See the [Unstable connection scenario](#unstable-connection-scenario) example.

### Network scenarios

Network scenarios are built-in (or custom) presets for network types that simulate a specific scenario, such as intermittent lag spikes. They allow you simulate a variable combination of issues and automatically switching configuration presets.

You can use the Network Simulator SDK to create custom network scenarios that automatically trigger network events (such as a lag spike) at specific frequencies and intervals.

The code samples in this section showcase how you can build custom network simulator scenarios.

#### Lag spike scenario

The following code snippet demonstrates using `NetworkScenarioTask` to create a custom network scenario that simulates a connection with [lag spikes](#lag-spikes). See [`LagSpikeScenarioWithAsyncTask.cs`](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.tools/blob/develop/Samples~/NetworkSimulator/LagSpikeScenarioWithAsyncTask.cs#L27).

#### Disconnect scenario

The following code snippet uses `NetworkScenarioBehaviour` to create a custom network scenario that simulates a connection with frequent player [disconnects](#disconnects). See [`DisconnectScenarioWithMonoBehaviour.cs`](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.tools/blob/develop/Samples~/NetworkSimulator/DisconnectScenarioWithMonoBehaviour.cs).

#### Unstable connection scenario

The following code snippet demonstrates using `NetworkScenarioTask` to create a custom network scenario that simulates an [unstable connection](#instability). See [`UnstableConnection.cs`](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.tools/blob/develop/Samples~/NetworkSimulator/UnstableConnection.cs).

#### Affect connection parameters using Animation Curves scenario

The following code snippet uses `NetworkScenarioBehaviour` to create a custom network scenario that simulates multiple connection problems. It dynamically changes multiple connection parameters using Animation Curves. See [`ConnectionParametersWithCurves.cs`](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.tools/blob/develop/Samples~/NetworkSimulator/ConnectionParametersWithCurves.cs).

The sample scenario showcases a dynamic scenario using an animation curve loop with variable [packet delays](#latency), [packet jittering](#jitter), and [packet loss](#packet-loss).
