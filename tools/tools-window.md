title: Multiplayer Tools Window
---

The Multiplayer Tools window provides convenient access to all of the multiplayer tools and their documentation in one place. 
In the case where some tools are unavailable because of a missing dependency, an explanatory message is displayed.


You can open the window by navigating to **Window** > **Multiplayer Tools**.

Due to restrictions in the Profiler API, the Network Profiler modules cannot be automatically loaded. The **Open** button in the window shown above opens the profiler window, and you will need to select the profiler modules as described in [Profiler](profiler.md).:::
