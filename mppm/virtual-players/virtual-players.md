Unity's [**Play mode**](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/GameView.html) uses the **Main Editor Player** to test your gameplay. By adding the **Multiplayer Play Mode (MPPM)** package, you can enable up to 3 additional **Virtual Players** to the **Play mode** for a total of 4 players to test projects with multiple players.
