title: Activate a Virtual Player
description: Enable up to three additional Virtual Players to your main Editor Player in Multiplayer Play Mode.
---

To use a Virtual Player to test multiplayer gameplay, activate at least one Virtual Player.

The first time you enable a Virtual Player Unity creates a new local folder in `C://Users/[YourName]/[ProjectName]Library/VP` that contains the data for each Virtual Player you activate. When you deactivate a Virtual Player, Unity caches its corresponding folder to use again when you re-activate it.

:::info
You can only attach tags to inactive Players (including the main Editor Player). To use tags, [create and configure your tags](../player-tags/player-tags-create.md) before you enable virtual Players.
