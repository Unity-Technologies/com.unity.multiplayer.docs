The logic in the following example checks if the **Player Tag** has a string rather than if itâ€™s equal to a string to allow for more flexibility with the name of the **Player Tag**. You can change this logic so that it checks for an exact match.

:::important
The following example uses the `Contains` method, which is case-sensitive by default. You can make it case-insensitive by passing the `System.StringComparison.CurrentCultureIgnoreCase` method.

## Automatically assign a Player to a team

The following script automatically sets a [NetworkVariable](https://docs-multiplayer.unity3d.com/netcode/current/basics/networkvariable/) called `Team` based on the Player Tag.

A Player with a `Red` Player Tag automatically sets the `Team` NetworkVariable to `Red`. A Player with a `Blue` Player Tag automatically sets the `Team` NetworkVariable to `Blue`.

```csharp
using Unity.Netcode;
using UnityEngine;
using Unity.Multiplayer.Playmode;

public enum Team { Blue, Red, }

/// A player with a team that is automatically assigned
/// based on the Player Tag of the client that owns them
public class Player : NetworkBehaviour
{
    public NetworkVariable<Team> team = new (writePerm: NetworkVariableWritePermission.Owner);

    void Start()
    {
        var localClientId = NetworkManager.Singleton.LocalClientId;
        if (!team.CanClientWrite(localClientId))
        {
            return;
        }
        var mppmTag = CurrentPlayer.ReadOnlyTags();
        if (mppmTag.Contains("Blue"))
        {
            team.Value = Team.Blue;
        }
        if (mppmTag.Contains("Red"))
        {
            team.Value = Team.Red;
        }
    }
}
```
