Player Tags are similar to launch arguments for Players (both the Main Editor Player and Virtual Players) that you can use to configure Players to behave in a specific way. For example:

- Run as a client, server, or host automatically
- Automatically run as a member of a specific team (for example, “Red Team” or “Blue Team”)
- Move faster or slower to simulate their network connection

You can assign multiple tags to a player.
