---
To troubleshoot an Error that appears when you enter Play Mode, refer to the Error message that appears in the console window. You can also open the [play mode scenario status dropdown](LINK) for more information.

To fix the error **Build profile needs to match the current platform**: 
1. Open the Build Profile window ( **File** > **Build Profiles**). 
2. In the **Platforms** list, select the platform that matches the platform that the Unity Editor is running on.
