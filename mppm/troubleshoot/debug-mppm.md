Use the Test Runner included in the [Unity Test Framework (UTF)](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.test-framework@2.0/manual/index.html) to test players in a multiplayer project.

## Test a player
To open the Test Runner window go to **Window** > **General** > **Test Runner**.

To learn how to run a test in Unity, refer to [Running Play Mode tests in a player](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.test-framework@2.0/manual/workflow-run-playmode-test-standalone.html).

When you run a test with Multiplayer Play Mode installed the test runner indicates which player passed or failed a test. To learn more about test results in the test runner, use the [TestStatus enum](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.test-framework@2.0/api/UnityEditor.TestTools.TestRunner.Api.TestStatus.html).
