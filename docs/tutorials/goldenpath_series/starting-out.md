title:  Learning with Golden Path Introduction
description: Introduction to the Golden Path series, explaining the underliying aim of the series 
---

These sections are intended to help guide you through the features of  Netcode for GameObjects (Netcode), they will provide  examples of how Netcode implements common  Multiplayer features. We will continue to add and update this section with more materials as we grow Netcode.  

:::tip
You do not have to have completed either of the [Hello World tutorials](../helloworld/helloworldintro.md) to complete this one, however, if you are new to Unity then we recommended that you complete them in order to familiarise yourself with Unity.
:::

You should start by following the [GoldenPath Foundation Module](../../tutorials/goldenpath_series/goldenpath_foundation_module.md) then move on to the other modules which contain areas that interest you. Some of the modules are built on top of the Foundation Module others are stand alone. for those that are built on the Foundation Module we will recommend creating a clone of that project.

:::funfact
In the context of software or information modelling, a Golden Path (sometimes called happy path) is a default scenario featuring no exceptional or error conditions.

## Requirements

These tutorials requires an Netcode-supported version of Unity (2020.3+).
