title:  Introduction to the Golden Path Series
description: Introduction to the Golden Path series, explaining the underliying aim of the series 
---

The Golden Path series is intended to help guide you through the features of Netcode for Gameobjects (Netcode) and provide  examples of how Netcode implements common Multiplayer features. This series will grow with Netcode.

:::tip
You do not have to complete either of the [Hello World tutorials](../helloworld/helloworldintro.md) to work through the Golden Path series. There are slight differences between the Golden Path beginning modules and Hello World guides. However, the Hello World guides are intended to familarize yourself with Unity and test that you've built Netcode correctly.
:::

Start with the [Foundation Module](../../tutorials/goldenpath_series/goldenpath_foundation_module.md) as the base for other modules to clone and build on. Then explore the other modules based on interest.

:::funfact Fun Fact
In the context of software or information modelling, a Golden Path (sometimes called "happy path") is a default scenario featuring no exceptional or error conditions.

## Prerequisites

All tutorials require a Netcode-supported version of Unity (2019.4+).
