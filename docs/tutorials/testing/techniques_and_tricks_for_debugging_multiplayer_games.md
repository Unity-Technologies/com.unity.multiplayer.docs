When debugging games, multiplayer games included, it helps to know the toolbag that we have at our disposal. 

All the conventional game development wisdom applies, however certain scenarios that are typical to multiplayer game development call for special tricks and approaches.

Below is a list of practices and techniques that we use daily when working on the Boss Room sample. These recommendations, we find, compound into a more comfortable working experience when developing multiplayer games with Unity. 

## Debugging tricks for multiplayer games

### Use ParrelSync clone-based workflow during development.

[ParrelSync workflow](testing_locally.md#parrelsync) is faster than creating builds and it allows you to debug the separate editor instances via separate IDE debuggers.

Use ParrelSync to run separate editor instances for your Host/Server and Client.
 
### Use debug drawing techniques extensively.

Unity engine has two debug rendering APIs that are very useful for the purposes of multiplayer game debugging:
 - [Debug.DrawRay](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Debug.DrawRay.html)
 - [Debug.DrawLine](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Debug.DrawLine.html)

Both of these functions allow us to draw arbitrary debug lines that would be visible in the Scene view and in the Game view, provided Gizmo rendering is enabled (to enable Gizmo rendering in Game view you need to click on the `Gizmos` menu at the top of the Game view).

The key trick here is to use different colors for different kinds of information and to make the lines stay long enough for visual inspection by setting `duration` parameter. This technique shines when it is combined with [screen recordings](#7-recording-the-video-of-gameplay) of [multiple peers running side by side in separate editor instances via ParrelSync](#1-use-parrelsync-workflow-during-development).

The code below would render a green debug line that's 2 units tall at the position of the transform, and this line would stay on screen for 4 seconds:
`Debug.DrawLine(this.transform.position, this.transform.position + Vector3.UP * 2f, Color.green, duration: 4f);`

When working on Boss Room we found it valuable to draw debug lines for the following items:
 - Visual position
 - Network position
 - Movement intention
 - Object interactions

In case we need to show debug lines in our builds - we can use LineRenderer. An example component below showcases how you can use LineRenderer as a runtime replacement for debug lines:

```c#
public class UsingLineRendererForDebugging : MonoBehaviour
{
    LineRenderer m_lineRenderer;
    Vector3 m_positions;
    
    void Awake()
    {
        //we would want to cache our reference to the line renderer component to avoid having to do expensive component lookup
        m_lineRenderer = gameObject.AddComponent<LineRenderer>();

        //we know that we're going to be drawing a line between two points, so we need 
        m_positions = new Vector3[2];
    }

    void Update()
    {
        //set the start and end positions of our line
        m_positions[0] = this.transform.position;
        m_positions[1] = this.transform.position + Vector3.UP * 2f;

        //set the beginning and ending width of the line in units, 0.1f corresponding to 10cm.
        m_lineRenderer.startWidth = 0.1f;
        m_lineRenderer.endWidth = 0.1f;

        //feed the values to the line renderer
        m_lineRenderer.SetPositions(m_positions);

        //and ensure that the line renderer knows to draw in world space
        m_lineRenderer.useWorldSpace = true;
    }
}
```

### Use debug logging for situations where visual debugging is not appropriate.

Text-based logging is valuable for tracking down non-visual events (such as RPCs) and information.
It is a good idea to include network tick and client id in log messages so that it's easier to build a timeline when reading the logs.

### Use the artificial network conditioning tools.

The options that are currently available to us are covered in the related [article on artificial network conditioning tools](testing_with_artificial_conditions.md).

Of particular interest to us is the application-level network conditioning provided by [Unity Transport Simulator Tools](testing_with_artificial_conditions.md#unity-transport---simulator-tools), as it allows us to easily specify conditions for our individual peers that live within separate editors by means of ParrelSync.

Artificial network conditions allow the errors and oddities that are hidden by nigh-absence of lag when running your instances locally to show up, and it's a good thing!

### Capturing screen recordings of the game instances.

First of all, it is very valuable to record both your Client and Server at the same time - it allows you to compare what is happening on either peer in realtime.

When recording your screen, sometimes it’s hard to see if we are legitimately missing an update in our game or if it’s just our recording refresh rate isn’t synced with Unity’s refresh calls. 

In debug builds it's a great idea to show the Peer ID and the current frame number somewhere in the corner of the screen - this way there is a visual reference to the number of the frame we're currently observing on the recording.

Sometimes, despite us using good debug rendering and logging it's still hard to understand what's going on even when going through the frames one by one. Increasing our FixedTimeStep setting to a ridiculous value (something as high as `0.2`) helps to have more time to really see what’s going on.

The same applies to very high latencies (1000ms) - these stress the lag hiding techniques, allowing us to visualize what the different lag hiding techniques are doing.
