title: Get started with NGO
---

Use this guide to learn how to create your first NGO project. It walks you through creating a simple Hello World project that implements the basic features of Netcode for GameObjects (NGO).

Refer to [Testing the command line helper](command-line-helper) to learn how to test your builds with a command line helper.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- An active Unity account with a valid license.
- The [Unity Hub](https://unity.com/download).
- A NGO-supported version of the Unity Editor. Refer to the [NGO requirements](https://docs-multiplayer.unity3d.com/netcode/current/installation/install).

Before continuing, create a new project using Unity Editor version 2021.3 or later.

:::tip

If you don't already have an `Assets/Scripts/` folder, create one now:

1. Right-click the **Assets** folder in the **Projects** tab, then select **Create** > **Folder**.
2. Name the new folder **Scripts**.

This is where you'll keep all your scripts.

:::

## Install Netcode for GameObjects

Refer to [Install Netcode for GameObjects](https://docs-multiplayer.unity3d.com/netcode/current/installation/install).

## Add the basic components

This section guides you through adding the essential components of a networked game:

- [A NetworkManager component](#create-the-networkmanager-component)
- [A player object](#create-an-object-to-spawn-for-each-connected-player)
- [A scene](#add-your-scene-to-the-build)

### Create the NetworkManager component

This section guides you through creating a NetworkManager component.

First, create the NetworkManager component:

1. Right-click in the **Hierarchy** tab, then select **Create Empty** to create an empty GameObject.

![](../../static/img/get-started-ngo/ngo-10.png)

2. Rename the empty GameObject **NetworkManager**.

![](../../static/img/get-started-ngo/ngo-11.png)

3. Select **NetworkManager**, then select **Add Component** from the **Inspector** tab.

![](../../static/img/get-started-ngo/ngo-6.png)

4. Select **Netcode** > **NetworkManager** from the component list.

![](../../static/img/get-started-ngo/ngo-1.png)

5. In the Inspector tab, locate the Unity Transport section, then select **UnityTransport** as the **Protocol type**.

![](../../static/img/get-started-ngo/ngo-13.png)

![](../../static/img/get-started-ngo/ngo-14.png)

6. Save the scene by pressing **Ctrl/Cmd** + **S** (or by selecting **File** > **Save**).

### Create an object to spawn for each connected player

:::important

When you drop the prefab into the **PlayerPrefab** slot, you're telling the library that when a client connects to the game, it automatically spawns this prefab as the character for the connecting client. NGO won’t spawn a player object if you don't have any prefab set as the **PlayerPrefab**. Refer to [Player Objects](../basics/networkobject#finding-player-objects).

:::

This section guides you through creating an object that spawns for each connected player.

1. In the Unity Editor, right-click within the **Hierarchy** tab, then select **3D Object** > **Capsule**.
2. Name the Capsule Object **Player**.
3. With Player selected, add a NetworkObject component in the **Inspector** tab by selecting **Add Component** > **Netcode** > **NetworkObject**.
4. Right-click within the **Assets** folder under the **Project** tab, then select **Create** > **Folder**.
5. Name the folder **Prefabs**.
6. Make the **Player** object you created earlier into a prefab by dragging it from the **Hierarchy** tab into the **Prefabs** folder.

![](../../static/img/get-started-ngo/ngo-12.png)

7. Delete the Player from the scene by selecting the Player capsule within the **Scene** tab, then pressing the **Delete** key (or **Cmd** + **Delete** for macOS).

:::tip

You can remove the Player GameObject from the scene because you assign this network prefab to the Player prefab property in the NetworkManager component. The library doesn't support defining a player object as an in-scene placed NetworkObject.

:::

8. Select **NetworkManager**.
9. With NetworkManager selected, locate the **PlayerPrefab** field in the **Inspector** tab.

![](../../static/img/get-started-ngo/ngo-9.png)

10. Drag the **Player** prefab from the **Project** tab into the **PlayerPrefab** slot you created in the **Inspector** tab.

![](../../static/img/get-started-ngo/ngo-5.png)

11. Add a 3D Plane (centered at 0,0,0) to the scene by right-clicking in the **Hierarchy** tab, then selecting **3D Object** > **Plane**.

:::note

Adding the Plane adds a visual reference point to visualize the Player prefab’s position, but it isn’t necessary.

:::

![](../../static/img/get-started-ngo/ngo-7.png)

12. Save the scene by pressing **Ctrl/Cmd** + **S** (selecting **File** > **Save**).

### Add your scene to the build

This section guides you through adding your scene to the build.

The **Enable Scene Management** for the `NetworkManager` setting allows the server to control which scenes load for the clients. However, you must add the current scene to the build to enter Play mode.

:::note

The **Enable Scene Management** option for the NetworkManager is enabled by default.

:::

1. Open the Build Settings window by selecting **File** > **Build Settings**.
2. Select **Add Open Scenes**.

**Scenes/SampleScene** is listed under **Scenes In Build**. You can close the Build Settings window.

## Add RPCs

This section guides you through adding basic RPCs to the project.

:::tip

If you don't already have an `Assets/Scripts/` folder, create one now:

1. Right-click the **Assets** folder in the **Projects** tab, then select **Create** > **Folder**.
2. Name the new folder **Scripts**.

This is where you'll keep all your scripts.

:::

Create a script named `RpcTest.cs`:

1. In the **Project** tab, select **Assets** > **Scripts**.
2. Right-click in the **Scripts** folder and select **Create** > **C# Script**.
3. Name the script `RpcTest`.

Add the `RpcTest.cs` script to the Player prefab:

1. Select the **Player** prefab in **Assets** > **Prefabs**.
2. In the **Inspector** tab (with the Player prefab selected), select **Add Component**.
3. Select **Scripts** > **Rpc Test**.

Edit the `RpcTest.cs` script:

1. In the **Project** tab, select **Assets** > **Scripts** > **`RpcTest`**.
2. In the **Inspector** tab (with the script selected), select **Open**. This opens this script in the default local text editor.
3. Edit the `RpcTest.cs` script to match the following:

```csharp
using Unity.Netcode;
using UnityEngine;

public class RpcTest : NetworkBehaviour
{
    public override void OnNetworkSpawn()
    {
        if (!IsServer && IsOwner) //Only send an RPC to the server on the client that owns the NetworkObject that owns this NetworkBehaviour instance
        {
            TestServerRpc(0, NetworkObjectId);
        }
    }

    [ClientRpc]
    void TestClientRpc(int value, ulong sourceNetworkObjectId)
    {
        Debug.Log($"Client Received the RPC #{value} on NetworkObject #{sourceNetworkObjectId}");
        if (IsOwner) //Only send an RPC to the server on the client that owns the NetworkObject that owns this NetworkBehaviour instance
        {
            TestServerRpc(value + 1, sourceNetworkObjectId);
        }
    }

    [ServerRpc]
    void TestServerRpc(int value, ulong sourceNetworkObjectId)
    {
        Debug.Log($"Server Received the RPC #{value} on NetworkObject #{sourceNetworkObjectId}");
        TestClientRpc(value, sourceNetworkObjectId);
    }
}
```

1. Save the Scene by pressing **Ctrl/Cmd** + **S** (or by selecting **File** > **Save**).

### Test the RPCs

This section guides you through testing the RPCs you added in the earlier section.

1. Select **File** > **Build And Run**.
2. Stop the player.
3. Launch the client and server together in a terminal, as shown in [Testing the command line helper](command-line-helper).

:::tip

Instead of using the command line helper script, you can use Multiplayer Play Mode (MPPM) package, which lets you run multiple instances of the Unity Editor to test multiplayer functionality. Refer to [Multiplayer Play Mode](https://docs-multiplayer.unity3d.com/tools/current/mppm) to learn more.

**Note**: MPPM is only supported in Unity Editor version 2023.1 and later.

:::

After the client and server spawn, a log displays in the **Console** of the client and server sending RPC messages to each other.

The client kicks off the exchange in its `Update` call for the first time with a counter value of `0`. It then makes an RPC call to the server with the next value. The server receives this and calls the client. The Console displays the following for the server and client respectively.

```log
Server Received the RPC #0 on NetworkObject #1
Server Received the RPC #1 on NetworkObject #1
Server Received the RPC #2 on NetworkObject #1
Server Received the RPC #3 on NetworkObject #1
...
```

```log
Client Received the RPC #0 on NetworkObject #1
Client Received the RPC #1 on NetworkObject #1
Client Received the RPC #2 on NetworkObject #1
Client Received the RPC #3 on NetworkObject #1
...
```

Only the client owning the `NetworkObject` owning the `RpcTest` script will send RPCs on the server, but they will all receive RPCs from the server. This means that if you test with multiple clients the consoles will log RPCs received once per `NetworkObject` per iteration on the server and all clients. If testing with a host and a client, you will see the following on the host's **Console**. This is because as a server it will receive the other client's server RPCs and as a client it will also receive its own client RPCs.

```log
Server Received the RPC #0 on NetworkObject #2
Client Received the RPC #0 on NetworkObject #2
Server Received the RPC #1 on NetworkObject #2
Client Received the RPC #1 on NetworkObject #2
Server Received the RPC #2 on NetworkObject #2
Client Received the RPC #2 on NetworkObject #2
Server Received the RPC #3 on NetworkObject #2
Client Received the RPC #3 on NetworkObject #2
...
```

:::note

The `NetworkObjectId` here is `2` because the host also has a NetworkObject with the `RpcTest` script spawned for it, but it won't send the initial RPC starting the chain because it's a server.

:::

## Extend the functionality with scripts

The section shows how to extend the functionality of the Hello World project with two scripts: [`HelloWorldPlayer.cs`](#the-helloworldplayercs-script) and [`HelloWorldManager.cs`](#the-helloworldmanagercs-script).

### The `HelloWorldManager.cs` script

1. Create a new script in the `Scripts` folder named `HelloWorldManager.cs`.
2. Create a new empty object, `HelloWorldManager`, in the scene and attach the script as a component.
3. Copy the following code into the `HelloWorldManager.cs` script:

```csharp
using Unity.Netcode;
using UnityEngine;

namespace HelloWorld
{
    public class HelloWorldManager : MonoBehaviour
    {
        void OnGUI()
        {
            GUILayout.BeginArea(new Rect(10, 10, 300, 300));
            if (!NetworkManager.Singleton.IsClient && !NetworkManager.Singleton.IsServer)
            {
                StartButtons();
            }
            else
            {
                StatusLabels();

                SubmitNewPosition();
            }

            GUILayout.EndArea();
        }

        static void StartButtons()
        {
            if (GUILayout.Button("Host")) NetworkManager.Singleton.StartHost();
            if (GUILayout.Button("Client")) NetworkManager.Singleton.StartClient();
            if (GUILayout.Button("Server")) NetworkManager.Singleton.StartServer();
        }

        static void StatusLabels()
        {
            var mode = NetworkManager.Singleton.IsHost ?
                "Host" : NetworkManager.Singleton.IsServer ? "Server" : "Client";

            GUILayout.Label("Transport: " +
                NetworkManager.Singleton.NetworkConfig.NetworkTransport.GetType().Name);
            GUILayout.Label("Mode: " + mode);
        }

        static void SubmitNewPosition()
        {
            if (GUILayout.Button(NetworkManager.Singleton.IsServer ? "Move" : "Request Position Change"))
            {
                if (NetworkManager.Singleton.IsServer && !NetworkManager.Singleton.IsClient )
                {
                    foreach (ulong uid in NetworkManager.Singleton.ConnectedClientsIds)
                        NetworkManager.Singleton.SpawnManager.GetPlayerNetworkObject(uid).GetComponent<HelloWorldPlayer>().Move();
                }
                else
                {
                    var playerObject = NetworkManager.Singleton.SpawnManager.GetLocalPlayerObject();
                    var player = playerObject.GetComponent<HelloWorldPlayer>();
                    player.Move();
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

1. Continue reading to understand what the example code means:

In the Hello World project from earlier, you created a NetworkManager by adding the pre-created NetworkManager component. This component allows you to start a Host, Client, or Server in Play mode by inspecting the component. The `HelloWorldManager.cs` script simplifies this slightly by creating an on-screen UI button menu upon entering Play mode.

:::tip

- The **Host** starts the server and joins as a client.
- The **Client** is joining the server as a client player.
- The **Server** starts the game as a server without instantiating a player.

The `HelloWorldManager.cs` script accomplishes this menu within the `StartButtons().` After you select a button, the `StatusLabels()`method adds a label on-screen to display which mode you have selected. This helps distinguish Game view windows from each other when testing your multiplayer game.

```csharp
       static void StartButtons()
        {
            if (GUILayout.Button("Host")) NetworkManager.Singleton.StartHost();
            if (GUILayout.Button("Client")) NetworkManager.Singleton.StartClient();
            if (GUILayout.Button("Server")) NetworkManager.Singleton.StartServer();
        }

        static void StatusLabels()
        {
            var mode = NetworkManager.Singleton.IsHost ?
                "Host" : NetworkManager.Singleton.IsServer ? "Server" : "Client";

            GUILayout.Label("Transport: " +
                NetworkManager.Singleton.NetworkConfig.NetworkTransport.GetType().Name);
            GUILayout.Label("Mode: " + mode);
        }
```

As seen in the earlier code snippet, the `HelloWorldManager.cs` script also utilizes the NetworkManager‘s instance via its singleton to grab properties like the `IsClient`, `IsServer`, and `IsLocalClient`. The `IsClient` and `IsServer` properties dictate the established connection state.

:::note

The `HelloWorldManager.cs` script introduces a new method called `SubmitNewPosition()` that the `HelloWorldPlayer` script uses to [create a simple RPC call](#add-simple-rpc-use).

:::

### `The HelloWorldPlayer.cs` Script

:::tip

If you don't already have an `Assets/Scripts/` folder, create one now:

1. Right-click the **Assets** folder in the **Projects** tab, then select **Create** > **Folder**.
2. Name the new folder **Scripts**.

This is where you'll keep all your scripts.

:::

1. Create a new script in the `Scripts` folder named `HelloWorldPlayer.cs`.
2. Add the script as a component to your Player prefab.
3. Copy the following code into the `HelloWorldPlayer.cs` script:

```csharp
using Unity.Netcode;
using UnityEngine;

namespace HelloWorld
{
    public class HelloWorldPlayer : NetworkBehaviour
    {
        public NetworkVariable<Vector3> Position = new NetworkVariable<Vector3>();

        public override void OnNetworkSpawn()
        {
            if (IsOwner)
            {
                Move();
            }
        }

        public void Move()
        {
            if (NetworkManager.Singleton.IsServer)
            {
                var randomPosition = GetRandomPositionOnPlane();
                transform.position = randomPosition;
                Position.Value = randomPosition;
            }
            else
            {
                SubmitPositionRequestServerRpc();
            }
        }

        [ServerRpc]
        void SubmitPositionRequestServerRpc(ServerRpcParams rpcParams = default)
        {
            Position.Value = GetRandomPositionOnPlane();
        }

        static Vector3 GetRandomPositionOnPlane()
        {
            return new Vector3(Random.Range(-3f, 3f), 1f, Random.Range(-3f, 3f));
        }

        void Update()
        {
            transform.position = Position.Value;
        }
    }
}
```

1. Continue reading to understand what the code means:

The `HelloWorldPlayer.cs` script adds some basic movement to the Hello World project player. Both the server player and the client player can start player movement. However, the movement occurs through the server’s position NetworkVariable, which means the server player can move immediately, but the client player must request a movement from the server, wait for the server to update the position NetworkVariable, then replicate the change locally.

The `HelloWorldPlayer` class inherits from `Unity.Netcode`‘s `NetworkBehaviour` instead of `MonoBehaviour`. This allows you to customize the networking code as you override what happens when the Player spawns.

```csharp
public class HelloWorldPlayer : NetworkBehaviour
```

For multiplayer games, every object runs on at least two machines: player one and player two. Because of this, you need to ensure both machines have the same behavior and have the correct information about the object. One of the instances that come into play then is to understand how the Player moves. Only one player controls how the Player object moves. The following code enforces this by validating if the machine running the code is the player's owner.

```csharp
       public override void OnNetworkSpawn()
        {
            if (IsOwner)
            {
                Move();
            }
        }
```

Any `MonoBehaviour` implementing a NetworkBehaviour component can override the Netcode method `OnNetworkSpawn()`. The `OnNetworkSpawn()` method fires in response to the `NetworkObject` spawning. The `HelloWorldPlayer` class overrides `OnNetworkSpawn` because clients and the server run different logic.

:::note

You can override this behavior on any NetworkBehaviour component.

:::

Because the server and client can be the same machine and the Player's owner (aka Host), you want further to differentiate the two and have different Move behavior for each.

If the current player is the server, the code determines a random position to spawn the Player. You can’t find the spawn location if the current player is the client. You have to get it from the server.

```csharp
       public void Move()
        {
            if (NetworkManager.Singleton.IsServer)
            {
                var randomPosition = GetRandomPositionOnPlane();
                transform.position = randomPosition;
                Position.Value = randomPosition;
            }
            else
            {
                SubmitPositionRequestServerRpc();
            }
        }

[ServerRpc]
        void SubmitPositionRequestServerRpc(ServerRpcParams rpcParams = default)
        {
            Position.Value = GetRandomPositionOnPlane();
        }

        void Update()
        {
            transform.position = Position.Value;
        }
```

#### Add the `HelloWorldPlayer.cs` script to the Player prefab

This section guides you through adding the `HelloWorldPlayer.cs` script to the Player prefab.

Select the Player prefab:

1. From the **Project** tab, select **Assets** > **Prefabs**.
2. Select **Player**.

Add the `HelloWorldPlayer.cs` script to the Player prefab as a component:

1. With the Player prefab selected, select **Add Component** from the Inspector tab.
2. Select **Scripts** > **Hello World** > **Hello World Player**.

#### About the `HelloWorldPlayer` script

The `HelloWorldPlayer` class inherits from `NetworkBehaviour` instead of `MonoBehaviour`.

```csharp
public class HelloWorldPlayer : NetworkBehaviour
```

The `HelloWorldPlayer` class defines a `NetworkVariable` to represent the player's networked position.

```csharp
public NetworkVariable<Vector3> Position = new NetworkVariable<Vector3>();
```

The `HelloWorldPlayer` class overrides `OnNetworkSpawn`.

```csharp
       public override void OnNetworkSpawn()
        {
            if (IsOwner)
            {
                Move();
            }
        }
```

The script calls the `Move()` method on both client and server instances of the player. The `Move()` script does the following:

```csharp
       public void Move()
        {
            if (NetworkManager.Singleton.IsServer)
            {
                var randomPosition = GetRandomPositionOnPlane();
                transform.position = randomPosition;
                Position.Value = randomPosition;
            }
            else
            {
                SubmitPositionRequestServerRpc();
            }
        }
```

## Add simple RPC use

This section walks you through the sample code that adds a simple RPC.

If the player is a server-owned player at `OnNetworkSpawn()`, you can immediately move this player, as suggested in the following code.

```csharp
           if (NetworkManager.Singleton.IsServer)
            {
                var randomPosition = GetRandomPositionOnPlane();
                transform.position = randomPosition;
                Position.Value = randomPosition;
            }
```

If the player is a client, the script calls a `ServerRpc`. Clients can invoke a `ServerRpc` to execute on the server.

```csharp
           else
            {
                SubmitPositionRequestServerRpc();
            }
```

The `ServerRpc` sets the position NetworkVariable on the server's instance of the player by just picking a random point on the plane.

```csharp
       [ServerRpc]
        void SubmitPositionRequestServerRpc(ServerRpcParams rpcParams = default)
        {
            Position.Value = GetRandomPositionOnPlane();
        }
```

The server instance of the player modifies the `Position` `NetworkVariable` through the `ServerRpc`. If the player is a client, it must apply the position locally inside the `Update` loop.

```csharp
       void Update()
        {
            transform.position = Position.Value;
        }
```

Because the `HelloWorldPlayer.cs` script handles the position NetworkVariable, the `HelloWorldManager.cs` script can define the contents of `SubmitNewPosition()`.

```csharp
       static void SubmitNewPosition()
        {
            if (GUILayout.Button(NetworkManager.Singleton.IsServer ? "Move" : "Request Position Change"))
            {
                var playerObject = NetworkManager.Singleton.SpawnManager.GetLocalPlayerObject();
                var player = playerObject.GetComponent<HelloWorldPlayer>();
                player.Move();
            }
        }
```

The method in the code block above adds a contextual button that changes depending on whether the client is a server or a client. When you press the button this method creates, it finds your local player and calls `Move()`.

You can now create a build that shows the concepts outlined above.

Create two build instances: one for the host and the other for the client (to join the host's game).

Both build instances can move the player with the GUI button. The server moves the player immediately and replicates the movement on the client.

The client can request a new position, instructing the server to change that instance's position `NetworkVariable`. After the server updates the position `NetworkVariable`, the client applies that `NetworkVariable` position inside its `Update()` method.

### Add a NetworkTransform

This section guides you through adding a `NetworkTransform` component that moves the player.

Add a NetworkTransform component to the Player prefab:

1. Select the **Player** prefab in Assets > Prefabs.
2. In the **Inspector** tab (with the Player prefab selected), select **Add Component**.
3. Select **Netcode** > **NetworkTransform**.

Create a script named `NetworkTransformTest.cs`.

1. In the **Project** tab, go to **Assets** > **Scripts**.
2. Right-click, then select **Create** > **C# Script**.
3. Name it `NetworkTransformTest`.

Add the `NetworkTransformTest` script to the Player prefab:

1. Select the **Player** prefab in **Assets** > **Prefabs**.
2. In the **Inspector** tab (with the Player prefab selected), select **Add Component**.
3. Select **Scripts** > **Network Transform Test**.

Edit the `NetworkTransformTest.cs` script:

1. In the **Project** tab, select **Assets** > **Scripts** > **`NetworkTransformTest`**.
2. In the **Inspector** tab (with the script selected), select **Open**. This opens this script in the default local text editor.
3. Edit the `NetworkTransformTest.cs` script to match the following:

```csharp
using System;
using Unity.Netcode;
using UnityEngine;

public class NetworkTransformTest : NetworkBehaviour
{
    void Update()
    {
        if (IsServer)
        {
            float theta = Time.frameCount / 10.0f;
            transform.position = new Vector3((float) Math.Cos(theta), 0.0f, (float) Math.Sin(theta));
        }
    }
}
```

1. Save the scene by pressing **Ctrl/Cmd** + **S** (or by selecting **File** > **Save**).

#### Test the NetworkTransform

This section guides you through testing the NetworkTransform you added in the earlier section.

1. Select **File** > **Build And Run**.
2. Stop the player.
3. Launch the client and server together in a terminal as shown in [Test the command line helper](command-line-helper).

After the client and server spawn, the player capsule moves in a circle on both the client and the server.

## Test Hello World

To check if everything works as expected, test starting a host in the Unity Editor. A host plays the role of a server and a client at the same time.

You can test your Hello World project through the Unity Editor or a command line helper. If you choose the latter, refer to [Create a command line helper](command-line-helper). Otherwise, refer to the following instructions to test through the Unity Editor. Only the Plane appears on the server until the first client connects. Then, NGO spawns a new Player prefab for each connected client; however, they overlap in the Game view.

1. Select **Play** from the top of the Unity Editor to start the scene.

1. With **NetworkManager** selected (in the Hierarchy tab), select **Start Host** from the **Inspector** tab. Alternatively, you can use the in-game GUI buttons.

If it works correctly, the option to **Stop Host** displays in the **Inspector** tab.
