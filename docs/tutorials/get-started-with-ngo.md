title: Client-server quickstart for Netcode for GameObjects
---

Use this guide to learn how to create your first [client-server](../terms-concepts/client-server.md) Netcode for GameObjects project. It walks you through creating a simple Hello World project that implements the basic features of Netcode for GameObjects.

Refer to [Testing the command line helper](command-line-helper.md) to learn how to test your builds with a command-line helper.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you need the following:

- An active Unity account with a valid license.
- The [Unity Hub](https://unity.com/download).
- A supported version of the Unity Editor. Refer to the [Netcode for GameObjects requirements](https://docs-multiplayer.unity3d.com/netcode/current/installation).

Before continuing, create a new project using Unity Editor version 2022.3 or later.

### Create an `Assets/Scripts/` folder

If you don't already have an `Assets/Scripts/` folder, create one now:

1. Right-click the **Assets** folder in the **Projects** tab, then select **Create** > **Folder**.
2. Name the new folder **Scripts**.

This is where you'll keep all your scripts as part of this Hello World project.

## Install Netcode for GameObjects

Refer to [Install Netcode for GameObjects](https://docs-multiplayer.unity3d.com/netcode/current/installation).

## Add the basic components

This section guides you through adding the essential components of a networked game:

- [A NetworkManager component](#create-the-networkmanager-component)
- [A player object](#create-an-object-to-spawn-for-each-connected-player)
- [A scene](#add-your-scene-to-the-build)

### Create the NetworkManager component

This section guides you through creating a NetworkManager component.

First, create the NetworkManager component:

1. Right-click in the **Hierarchy** tab, then select **Create Empty** to create an empty GameObject.

![](/img/get-started-ngo/ngo-10.png)

2. Rename the empty GameObject **NetworkManager**.

![](/img/get-started-ngo/ngo-11.png)

3. Select **NetworkManager**, then select **Add Component** from the **Inspector** tab.

![](/img/get-started-ngo/ngo-6.png)

4. Select **Netcode** > **NetworkManager** from the component list.

![](/img/get-started-ngo/ngo-1.png)

5. In the Inspector tab, locate the Unity Transport section, then select **UnityTransport** as the **Protocol type**.

![](/img/get-started-ngo/ngo-13.png)

![](/img/get-started-ngo/ngo-14.png)

6. Save the scene by pressing **Ctrl/Cmd** + **S** (or by selecting **File** > **Save**).

### Create an object to spawn for each connected player

:::important

When you drop the prefab into the **PlayerPrefab** slot, you're telling the library that when a client connects to the game, it automatically spawns this prefab as the character for the connecting client. Netcode for GameObjects won't spawn a player object if you don't have any prefab set as the **PlayerPrefab**. Refer to [Player Objects](../basics/networkobject.md#finding-playerobjects).

:::

This section guides you through creating an object that spawns for each connected player.

1. In the Unity Editor, right-click within the **Hierarchy** tab, then select **3D Object** > **Capsule**.
2. Name the Capsule Object **Player**.
3. With Player selected, add a NetworkObject component in the **Inspector** tab by selecting **Add Component** > **Netcode** > **NetworkObject**.
4. Right-click within the **Assets** folder under the **Project** tab, then select **Create** > **Folder**.
5. Name the folder **Prefabs**.
6. Make the **Player** object you created earlier into a prefab by dragging it from the **Hierarchy** tab into the **Prefabs** folder.

![](/img/get-started-ngo/ngo-12.png)

7. Delete the Player from the scene by selecting the Player capsule within the **Scene** tab, then pressing the **Delete** key (or **Cmd** + **Delete** for macOS).
    * You can remove the Player GameObject from the scene because you assign this network prefab to the Player prefab property in the NetworkManager component. The library doesn't support defining a player object as an in-scene placed NetworkObject.
8. Select **NetworkManager**.
9. With NetworkManager selected, locate the **PlayerPrefab** field in the **Inspector** tab.

![](/img/get-started-ngo/ngo-9.png)

10. Drag the **Player** prefab from the **Project** tab into the **PlayerPrefab** slot within the **NetworkManager** component in the **Inspector** tab.

![](/img/get-started-ngo/ngo-5.png)

11. Add a 3D Plane (centered at 0,0,0) to the scene by right-clicking in the **Hierarchy** tab, then selecting **3D Object** > **Plane**.
    * Adding the Plane adds a visual reference point to visualize the Player prefab's position, but it isn't necessary.
![](/img/get-started-ngo/ngo-7.png)

12. Save the scene by pressing **Ctrl/Cmd** + **S** (selecting **File** > **Save**).

### Scene management and the scenes in build list

Netcode for GameObjects comes with an integrated scene management solution that helps you synchronize what scenes should be loaded by all connected clients. The `NetworkManager` **Enable Scene Management** property, enabled by default, determines whether the integrated scene management solution will be used for your project (or not). In order for the integrated scene management solution to work properly, you must add any scene you want to be synchronized to the scenes in build list. This section guides you through adding your current scene to the scenes in build list.

1. Open the Build Settings window by selecting **File** > **Build Settings**.
2. Select **Add Open Scenes**.
3. **Scenes/SampleScene** is listed under **Scenes In Build**. You can close the Build Settings window.

## Test starting a host in the Unity Editor

Now that you have a **NetworkManager**, assigned a **PlayerPrefab**, and added your current scene to the scenes in build test, you can quickly verify everything is functioning/configured correctly via entering play mode in the Unity Editor. By starting a host, you are starting `NetworkManager` as both a server and a client at the same time.

You can test your Hello World project using the Unity Editor or a command-line helper. If you choose the latter, refer to [Create a command line helper](../tutorials/command-line-helper/). Otherwise, refer to the following instructions to test using the Unity Editor. Only the Plane appears on the server until the first client connects. Then, Netcode for GameObjects spawns a new Player prefab for each connected client; however, they overlap in the Game view.

1. Select **Play** from the top of the Unity Editor to start the scene.

![](/img/get-started-ngo/ngo-8.png)

2. Select **NetworkManager** from the **Hierarchy** list.

![](\img\get-started-ngo\ngo-2.png)

3. With **NetworkManager** selected (in the Hierarchy tab), select **Start Host** from the **Inspector** tab. Alternatively, you can use the in-game GUI buttons.

![](/img/get-started-ngo/ngo-3.png)

If it works correctly, the option to **Stop Host** displays in the **Inspector** tab.


### The `HelloWorldManager.cs` script

Now that you have verified everything is configured correctly, you will want to have the ability to start the `NetworkManager` whether in play mode, as a stand alone build, or in another MPPM instance. This section will walk you through creating the `HelloWorldManager.cs` component script.

1. Create a new script in the `Scripts` folder named `HelloWorldManager.cs`.
2. Add this component to the `NetworkManager` `GameObject` in your scene.
3. Copy the following code into the `HelloWorldManager.cs` script:

```csharp
using Unity.Netcode;
using UnityEngine;

namespace HelloWorld
{
    public class HelloWorldManager : MonoBehaviour
    {
        private NetworkManager m_NetworkManager;

        void Awake()
        {
            m_NetworkManager = GetComponent<NetworkManager>();
        }

        void OnGUI()
        {
            GUILayout.BeginArea(new Rect(10, 10, 300, 300));
            if (!m_NetworkManager.IsClient && !m_NetworkManager.IsServer)
            {
                StartButtons();
            }
            else
            {
                StatusLabels();

                SubmitNewPosition();
            }

            GUILayout.EndArea();
        }

        static void StartButtons()
        {
            if (GUILayout.Button("Host")) m_NetworkManager.StartHost();
            if (GUILayout.Button("Client")) m_NetworkManager.StartClient();
            if (GUILayout.Button("Server")) m_NetworkManager.StartServer();
        }

        static void StatusLabels()
        {
            var mode = m_NetworkManager.IsHost ?
                "Host" : m_NetworkManager.IsServer ? "Server" : "Client";

            GUILayout.Label("Transport: " +
                m_NetworkManager.NetworkConfig.NetworkTransport.GetType().Name);
            GUILayout.Label("Mode: " + mode);
        }

        static void SubmitNewPosition()
        {
            if (GUILayout.Button(m_NetworkManager.IsServer ? "Move" : "Request Position Change"))
            {
                if (m_NetworkManager.IsServer && !m_NetworkManager.IsClient )
                {
                    foreach (ulong uid in m_NetworkManager.ConnectedClientsIds)
                        m_NetworkManager.SpawnManager.GetPlayerNetworkObject(uid).GetComponent<HelloWorldPlayer>().Move();
                }
                else
                {
                    var playerObject = m_NetworkManager.SpawnManager.GetLocalPlayerObject();
                    var player = playerObject.GetComponent<HelloWorldPlayer>();
                    player.Move();
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In your Hello World project, you created a NetworkManager by adding the pre-created NetworkManager component to a `GameObject`. This component allows you to start a Host, Client, or Server in Play Mode via the inspector view. The `HelloWorldManager.cs` script simplifies and extends this functionality by creating a runtime/play mode UI menu that allows you to select the three different `NetworkManager` modes you can start:

- The **Host** starts the server and joins as a client.
- The **Client** joins the server as a client player.
- The **Server** starts the game as a server without instantiating a player.

The `HelloWorldManager.cs` script accomplishes this menu within the `StartButtons().` After you select a button, the `StatusLabels()`method adds a label on-screen to display which mode you have selected. This helps distinguish Game view windows from each other when testing your multiplayer game.

```csharp
       static void StartButtons()
        {
            if (GUILayout.Button("Host")) NetworkManager.Singleton.StartHost();
            if (GUILayout.Button("Client")) NetworkManager.Singleton.StartClient();
            if (GUILayout.Button("Server")) NetworkManager.Singleton.StartServer();
        }

        static void StatusLabels()
        {
            var mode = NetworkManager.Singleton.IsHost ?
                "Host" : NetworkManager.Singleton.IsServer ? "Server" : "Client";

            GUILayout.Label("Transport: " +
                NetworkManager.Singleton.NetworkConfig.NetworkTransport.GetType().Name);
            GUILayout.Label("Mode: " + mode);
        }
```

As seen in the earlier code snippet, the `HelloWorldManager.cs` script also uses the NetworkManager's instance via its singleton to grab properties like the `IsClient`, `IsServer`, and `IsLocalClient`. The `IsClient` and `IsServer` properties dictate the established connection state.

The `HelloWorldManager.cs` script also introduces a new method called `SubmitNewPosition()` that the `HelloWorldPlayer` script uses to [create a simple RPC call](#add-simple-rpc-use).

## Adding RPCs (Remote Procedure Calls)

This section guides you through adding basic RPCs to the project. Save your scripts in your `Assets/Scripts/` folder. RPCs are used to call functions on remote clients or the server.

Create a script named `RpcTest.cs`:

1. In the **Project** tab, select **Assets** > **Scripts**.
2. Right-click in the **Scripts** folder and select **Create** > **C# Script**.
3. Name the script `RpcTest`.

Add the `RpcTest.cs` script to the Player prefab:

1. Select the **Player** prefab in **Assets** > **Prefabs**.
2. In the **Inspector** tab (with the Player prefab selected), select **Add Component**.
3. Select **Scripts** > **Rpc Test**.

Edit the `RpcTest.cs` script:

1. In the **Project** tab, select **Assets** > **Scripts** > **`RpcTest`**.
2. In the **Inspector** tab (with the script selected), select **Open**. This opens this script in the default local text editor.
3. Edit the `RpcTest.cs` script to match the following:

```csharp
using Unity.Netcode;
using UnityEngine;

public class RpcTest : NetworkBehaviour
{
    public override void OnNetworkSpawn()
    {
        if (!IsServer && IsOwner) //Only send an RPC to the server from the client that owns the NetworkObject of this NetworkBehaviour instance
        {
            ServerOnlyRpc(0, NetworkObjectId);
        }
    }

    [Rpc(SendTo.ClientsAndHost)]
    void ClientAndHostRpc(int value, ulong sourceNetworkObjectId)
    {
        Debug.Log($"Client Received the RPC #{value} on NetworkObject #{sourceNetworkObjectId}");
        if (IsOwner) //Only send an RPC to the owner of the NetworkObject
        {
            ServerOnlyRpc(value + 1, sourceNetworkObjectId);
        }
    }

    [Rpc(SendTo.Server)]
    void ServerOnlyRpc(int value, ulong sourceNetworkObjectId)
    {
        Debug.Log($"Server Received the RPC #{value} on NetworkObject #{sourceNetworkObjectId}");
        ClientAndHostRpc(value, sourceNetworkObjectId);
    }
}
```

4. Save the Scene by pressing **Ctrl/Cmd** + **S** (or by selecting **File** > **Save**).

### Test the RPCs

This section guides you through testing the RPCs you added in the earlier section.

1. Select **File** > **Build Setting...**.
2. In the **Build Setting** window, configure your build settings as needed.
3. Click **Build** and choose a location to save your first build.
4. After the first build is done, return to the **Build Setting** window.
5. Click **Build** again and choose a different location to save your second build.
    * Alternatively, you can run the builds by:
      - Launching the client and server together in a terminal, as shown in [Testing the command line helper](command-line-helper.md).
      - Using the Multiplayer Play Mode package, which lets you run multiple instances of the Unity Editor to test multiplayer functionality. Refer to [Multiplayer Play Mode](https://docs-multiplayer.unity3d.com/tools/current/mppm) to learn more.

After the client and server spawn, a log displays in the **Console** of the client and server sending RPC messages to each other.

The client kicks off the exchange in its `OnNetworkSpawn` call for the first time with a counter value of `0`. It then makes an RPC call to the server with the next value. The server receives this and calls the client. The Console displays the following for the server and client respectively.

```log
Server Received the RPC #0 on NetworkObject #1
Server Received the RPC #1 on NetworkObject #1
Server Received the RPC #2 on NetworkObject #1
Server Received the RPC #3 on NetworkObject #1
...
```

```log
Client Received the RPC #0 on NetworkObject #1
Client Received the RPC #1 on NetworkObject #1
Client Received the RPC #2 on NetworkObject #1
Client Received the RPC #3 on NetworkObject #1
...
```

Only the client owning the `NetworkObject` owning the `RpcTest` script will send RPCs on the server, but they will all receive RPCs from the server. This means that if you test with multiple clients the consoles will log RPCs received once per `NetworkObject` per iteration on the server and all clients. If testing with a host and a client, you will see the following on the host's **Console**. This is because as a server it will receive the other client's server RPCs and as a client it will also receive its own client RPCs.

```log
Server Received the RPC #0 on NetworkObject #2
Client Received the RPC #0 on NetworkObject #2
Server Received the RPC #1 on NetworkObject #2
Client Received the RPC #1 on NetworkObject #2
Server Received the RPC #2 on NetworkObject #2
Client Received the RPC #2 on NetworkObject #2
Server Received the RPC #3 on NetworkObject #2
Client Received the RPC #3 on NetworkObject #2
...
```

:::note

The `NetworkObjectId` here is `2` because the host also has a NetworkObject with the `RpcTest` script spawned for it, but it won't send the initial RPC starting the chain because it's a server.

:::

## Adding Netcode script to your player prefab

At this point, you should have set up script and should have experimented with sending and receiving RPCs via the `RpcTest.cs` script above. This next step demonstrates how you can add additional netcode logic to your player prefab via the `HelloWorldPlayer.cs` script.

1. Create a new script in the `Scripts` folder named `HelloWorldPlayer.cs`.
2. Copy the following code into the `HelloWorldPlayer.cs` script and save it:

```csharp
using Unity.Netcode;
using UnityEngine;

namespace HelloWorld
{
    public class HelloWorldPlayer : NetworkBehaviour
    {
        public NetworkVariable<Vector3> Position = new NetworkVariable<Vector3>();

        public override void OnNetworkSpawn()
        {
            if (IsOwner)
            {
                Move();
            }
        }

        public void Move()
        {
            SubmitPositionRequestRpc();
        }

        [Rpc(SendTo.Server)]
        void SubmitPositionRequestRpc(RpcParams rpcParams = default)
        {
            var randomPosition = GetRandomPositionOnPlane();
            transform.position = randomPosition;
            Position.Value = randomPosition;
        }

        static Vector3 GetRandomPositionOnPlane()
        {
            return new Vector3(Random.Range(-3f, 3f), 1f, Random.Range(-3f, 3f));
        }

        void Update()
        {
            transform.position = Position.Value;
        }
    }
}
```

#### A Review of the `HelloWorldPlayer.cs` script 

The `HelloWorldPlayer.cs` script adds some basic movement to the Hello World project player. Both the server player and the client player can start player movement. However, the movement occurs through the server's position NetworkVariable, which means the server player can move immediately, but the client player must request a movement from the server, wait for the server to update the position NetworkVariable, then replicate the change locally.

The `HelloWorldPlayer` class inherits from `Unity.Netcode`'s `NetworkBehaviour` instead of `MonoBehaviour`. This allows you to customize the networking code as you override what happens when the Player spawns.

```csharp
public class HelloWorldPlayer : NetworkBehaviour
```

For multiplayer games, every object runs on at least two machines: player one and player two. Because of this, you need to ensure both machines have the same behavior and have the correct information about the object. One of the instances that come into play then is to understand how the Player moves. Only one player controls how the Player object moves. The following code enforces this by validating if the machine running the code is the player's owner.

```csharp
       public override void OnNetworkSpawn()
        {
            if (IsOwner)
            {
                Move();
            }
        }
```

Any `MonoBehaviour` implementing a NetworkBehaviour component can override the Netcode for GameObjects method `OnNetworkSpawn()`. The `OnNetworkSpawn()` method fires in response to the `NetworkObject` spawning. The `HelloWorldPlayer` class overrides `OnNetworkSpawn` because clients and the server run different logic. You can override this behavior on any NetworkBehaviour component.

Because the server and client can be the same machine and the Player's owner (aka Host), you want further to differentiate the two and have different Move behavior for each.

If the current player is the server, the code determines a random position to spawn the Player. You can't find the spawn location if the current player is the client. You have to get it from the server.

```csharp
        public void Move()
        {
            SubmitPositionRequestRpc();
        }

        [Rpc(SendTo.Server)]
        void SubmitPositionRequestRpc(RpcParams rpcParams = default)
        {
            var randomPosition = GetRandomPositionOnPlane();
            transform.position = randomPosition;
            Position.Value = randomPosition;
        }

        void Update()
        {
            transform.position = Position.Value;
        }
```

#### Positioning the player using an RPC

This section walks you through the `HelloWorldPlayer.cs` portion of the script that declares the `SubmitPositionRequestRpc` RPC.

If the player is a server-owned player at `OnNetworkSpawn()`, you can immediately move this player, as suggested in the following code.

```csharp
            SubmitPositionRequestRpc();
```

You can call this `Rpc` when the player is a client or a server. When you call an `Rpc` with `SendTo.Server`  on the server side, it executes in the same way as a local function call by default.

The `Rpc` sets the position NetworkVariable on the server's instance of the player by just picking a random point on the plane.

```csharp
       [Rpc(SendTo.Server)]
        void SubmitPositionRequestRpc(RpcParams rpcParams = default)
        {
            var randomPosition = GetRandomPositionOnPlane();
            transform.position = randomPosition;
            Position.Value = randomPosition;
        }
```

The server instance of the player modifies the `Position` `NetworkVariable` through the `Rpc`. If the player is a client, it must apply the position locally inside the `Update` loop. (Since the two values are the same on the server, the server can run the same logic with no side effects, but you could also add `if(IsClient)` here.)

```csharp
       void Update()
        {
            transform.position = Position.Value;
        }
```

Because the `HelloWorldPlayer.cs` script handles the position NetworkVariable, the `HelloWorldManager.cs` script can define the contents of `SubmitNewPosition()`.

```csharp
       static void SubmitNewPosition()
        {
            if (GUILayout.Button(NetworkManager.Singleton.IsServer ? "Move" : "Request Position Change"))
            {
                var playerObject = NetworkManager.Singleton.SpawnManager.GetLocalPlayerObject();
                var player = playerObject.GetComponent<HelloWorldPlayer>();
                player.Move();
            }
        }
```

The method in the code block above adds a contextual button that changes depending on whether the client is a server or a client. When you press the button this method creates, it finds your local player and calls `Move()`.

You can now create a build that shows the concepts outlined above.

Create two build instances: one for the host and the other for the client (to join the host's game).

Both build instances can move the player with the GUI button. The server moves the player immediately and replicates the movement on the client.

The client can request a new position, instructing the server to change that instance's position `NetworkVariable`. After the server updates the position `NetworkVariable`, the client applies that `NetworkVariable` position inside its `Update()` method.

## Add the `HelloWorldPlayer.cs` script to the Player prefab

This section guides you through adding the `HelloWorldPlayer.cs` script to the Player prefab.

Select the Player prefab:

1. From the **Project** tab, select **Assets** > **Prefabs**.
2. Select **Player**.

Add the `HelloWorldPlayer.cs` script to the Player prefab as a component:

1. With the Player prefab selected, select **Add Component** from the Inspector tab.
2. Select **Scripts** > **Hello World** > **Hello World Player**.


## Add a NetworkTransform

This section guides you through adding a `NetworkTransform` component that moves the player. `NetworkTransform` is a component used to synchronize the position, rotation, and scale of objects across the network.

Add a NetworkTransform component to the Player prefab:

1. Select the **Player** prefab in Assets > Prefabs.
2. In the **Inspector** tab (with the Player prefab selected), select **Add Component**.
3. Select **Netcode** > **NetworkTransform**.

Create a script named `NetworkTransformTest.cs`.

1. In the **Project** tab, go to **Assets** > **Scripts**.
2. Right-click, then select **Create** > **C# Script**.
3. Name it `NetworkTransformTest`.

Add the `NetworkTransformTest` script to the Player prefab:

1. Select the **Player** prefab in **Assets** > **Prefabs**.
2. In the **Inspector** tab (with the Player prefab selected), select **Add Component**.
3. Select **Scripts** > **Network Transform Test**.

Edit the `NetworkTransformTest.cs` script:

1. In the **Project** tab, select **Assets** > **Scripts** > **`NetworkTransformTest`**.
2. In the **Inspector** tab (with the script selected), select **Open**. This opens this script in the default local text editor.
3. Edit the `NetworkTransformTest.cs` script to match the following:

```csharp
using System;
using Unity.Netcode;
using UnityEngine;

public class NetworkTransformTest : NetworkBehaviour
{
    void Update()
    {
        if (IsServer)
        {
            float theta = Time.frameCount / 10.0f;
            transform.position = new Vector3((float) Math.Cos(theta), 0.0f, (float) Math.Sin(theta));
        }
    }
}
```

4. Save the scene by pressing **Ctrl/Cmd** + **S** (or by selecting **File** > **Save**).

### Test the NetworkTransform

This section guides you through testing the NetworkTransform you added in the earlier section.

1. Select **File** > **Build Setting...**.
2. In the **Build Setting** window, configure your build settings as needed.
3. Click **Build** and choose a location to save your first build.
4. After the first build is done, return to the **Build Setting** window.

    * Alternatively, you can run the builds by:
      - Launching the client and server together in a terminal, as shown in [Testing the command line helper](command-line-helper.md).
      - Using the Multiplayer Play Mode package, which lets you run multiple instances of the Unity Editor to test multiplayer functionality. Refer to [Multiplayer Play Mode](https://docs-multiplayer.unity3d.com/tools/current/mppm) to learn more.
