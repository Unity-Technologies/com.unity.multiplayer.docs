You have now installed MLAPI.

## Create the Basic Components

1. Right click in the Hierarchy tab of the Main Unity Window.
1. Select **Create Empty**.
1. Rename the GameObject **NetworkManager**.
   
    ![create gameobject](/img/creategameobject.gif) 
  :::tip
  We renamed the GameObject because:
    * It makes it  easier to refer to later.
    * There is one and only one **NetworkManager**, this is the object that contains the  `NetworkManager` component.
  :::

  You have now created a new GameObject called **NetworkManager**.

1. Select **NetworkManager**.
1. Click **Add Component** in the Inspector Tab.
1. Select **MLAPI** from the list shown.
1. Select `NetworkManager` Component from the list displayed.
1. Inside the `NetworkManger` component tab, locate the  `NetworkTransport` field. 
1. Click "Select Transport".
1. Select `UnetTransport`.

1. Create 3D Object->Capsule (name it **Player**). 
1. Add a `NetworkObject` component.
1. Click the Assets folder.
1. Create a new Folder and call it **Prefabs**.
1. Make **Player** a prefab by draging it to **Prefabs** folder you jsut created.

1. Delete **Player** from scene.

  :::tip
  We remove **Player**, because we will be using the network library to spawn the player. The library cannot track objects that start in the scene.
  :::

1. Add Player prefab to `NetworkPrefabs` list inside of `NetworkManger`.
1. Select **Default Player Prefab.**

  ![addingdefaultprefab](/img/defaultplayerprefab.gif)

  :::tip
  When you select the **Default Player Prefab** , you are telling the library that when a client connect to the game, automatically spawn this prefab as the character for the connecting client. If you do not have the default selected for any prefab the game will crash on client connect
  :::

1. Create a GameObject->Plane, centered at (0,0,0).
1. Click **Play**.
1. Click **Start Host** under **NetworkingManager**.

:::note Congrats!!!!
Congratulations you have created a networked game. It is not a very flashy game but it is a networked game nonetheless. For the next steps in your journey see [Building on "Hello World"](helloworldparttwo.md)
