An RPC function **NEVER** executes its body immediately since the function call really is a stand-in for a network transmission. Even a `ServerRpc` called by a host (an instance that is a client and the server at the same time, aka listen-server) will not be executed immediately but instead, follow the regular network frame staging first and queued-up to be executed locally in the next network frame.

Structure of a typical `ServerRpc`:

```csharp
[ServerRpc]
void MyServerRpc(int somenumber, string somestring)
{
    // Network Send Block (framework-code)
    // Network Return Block (framework-code)
    // RPC Method Body (user-code)
}
```

Pseudo-code sample of a `ServerRpc`:

```csharp
[ServerRpc]
void MyServerRpc(int somenumber, string somestring)
{
    // --- begin: injected framework-code
    if (NetworkSend())
    {
        // this block will be executed if:
        //   - called from user-code on client
        //   - called from user-code on host

        var writer = NetworkCreateWriter();
        writer.WriteInt32(1234567890); // RPC method signature hash
        writer.WriteInt32(somenumber);
        writer.WriteChars(somestring);
        NetworkSendRpc(writer);
    }

    if (NetworkReturn())
    {
        // this block will be executed if:
        //   - called from user-code
        //   - called from framework-code on client

        return;
    }
    // --- end: injected framework-code

    print($"MyServerRpc: {somenumber}");
}
```
