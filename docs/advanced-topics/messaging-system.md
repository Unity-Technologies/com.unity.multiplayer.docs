The multiplayer framework provides two main network constructs to execute logic on either server-side or client-side: [`ServerRpc`](message-system/serverrpc.md) and [`ClientRpc`](message-system/clientrpc.md). This concept is often called Remote Procedure Call (RPC) and has wide adoption across the industry.

##Â RPC Methods
A typical framework user (Unity developer) can declare multiple RPCs under a `NetworkBehaviour` and inbound/outbound RPC calls will be replicated as a part of its replication in a network frame.

A method turned into an RPC is no longer a regular method, it will have its own implications on direct calls and in the network pipeline. See [Execution Table](message-system/execution-table.md).
