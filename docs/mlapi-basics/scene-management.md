The MLAPI can manage synchronized scene management for you. To use this, it first has to be enabled in `NetworkingConfiguration`. `EnableSceneSwitching` has to be set to true and all scenes that are going to be used during Networking have to be registered. The `NetworkingConfiguration.RegisteredScenes` list has to be populated with all scene names, this a simple security measure to ensure rogue servers don't request client's to switch to sensitive scenes.

:::note
The scene that is active when the Server is started has to be registered.

Usage:

```csharp
//This can only be called on the server
NetworkSceneManager.SwitchScene(mySceneName);
```
