:::important Compatibility
The Bitesize Samples have been built for a specific Unity version. You can see the version after adding a sample to the Unity Hub or in the description of the [repository](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.samples.bitesize). We recommend using the same Unity version to avoid potential issues.

## Troubleshooting

**Error building**

*Error:* Error building Player: Currently selected scripting backend (IL2CPP) is not installed.

Currently, you may need to have [Unity IL2CPP](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/IL2CPP.html) installed. Bitesize Samples should not require IL2CPP, and may have updates to resolve this error.
