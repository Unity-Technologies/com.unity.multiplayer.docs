## Clone the repo

You need to clone the code repo locally to work with in-development code.

First, install [Git](https://git-scm.com/) if you do not have it installed on your PC. After installing Git, restart your system. A full restart is required to update for Git or you may receive an error adding packages.

Next, decide on how you want to clone: command line or application.

:::tip Updated Local Code
We recommend updating your local clone often from the Netcode repository. This branch is constantly updated with new and updated features, fixed issues, and more.
:::

:::note Branching
If you want to make changes to *develop* code and content, you may want to create a local branch off of develop. Keep your branch updated from the remote develop branch to access fixes and updated features. Do not attempt to merge commits to the develop branch back into the respository. If you want to contribute, see [Netcode Contributing](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.mlapi/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines.

## Troubleshooting

**Errors with incorrect package loading**

If you receive a different package than Netcode when adding the URL to Unity Hub, you may have not correctly copied the GitHub URL. 

Hover over the URL to copy, click the **Copy** function in the code block, and use this when adding the package from a Git URL in Unity Hub.

**Errors adding package**

MacOS users may receive the following errors:

* `Cannot perform upm operation: Unable to add package... Error when executing git command. xcrun: error: invalid active developer path`
* `Error adding package...`

These are common errors for MacOS users that have not installed or updated Xcode or Xcode developer tools. You may need to upgrade your Xcode installation. In a terminal, use this command: `xcode-select --install`.

If you newly installed or updated Git, you may also need to restart your system. Restarting Unity may not be enough if you added Git and could receive a package loading error.

**Errors finding Git installation**

If you receive an OS or Unity error trying to locate Git after updating or installing Git, you need to fully restart your computer. Restarting only Unity may not fully update system information to correctly locate the install.

**VPN or Proxy Errors**

If you use VPN or proxy software from international locations, you may encounter access issues. Consider turning off your VPN service or selecting a different location.
