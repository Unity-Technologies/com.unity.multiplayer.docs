## What Is NetworkObject Visibility?
Object (NetworkObject) visibility is a Netcode for GameObjects term used to describe whether a `NetworkObject` is visible to one or more clients as it pertains to a netcode/network perspective.  When a `NetworkObject` is visible to a client, the server will assure the client has a spawned version (a clone) of the `NetworkObject`.  This also means that all network traffic generated by the server for the visible `NetworkObject` will be sent to all clients that are aware (that is, it's "visible to the clients") of it.  Likewise, when a `NetworkObject` is "hidden" (that is, not visible) from a client, then the client will despawn and destroy the `NetworkObject` if it was previously visible and no network traffic generated by the hidden `NetworkObject` will be received by the client(s) it's hidden from.


## Using Visibility

One way to determine visibility is to assign a callback to `NetworkObject.CheckObjectVisibility`.  This callback is invoked when new clients connect or just before the associated `NetworkObject` is spawned. Looking at the example below, we can see the callback includes a client identifier (clientId) value as a parameter which is used to determine whether the `NetworkObject` is visible to the client.  If `NetworkObject.CheckObjectVisibility` isn't assigned, then Netcode for GameObjects assumes it's visible to all clients.

### CheckObjectVisibility Callback Example
```csharp
public class VisibilityCheckExample : NetworkBehaviour
{
    public bool ContinuallyCheckVisibility = true;
    public float VisibilityDistance = 5.0f;

    /// <summary>
    /// This is automatically invoked when spawning the network prefab
    /// relative to each client.
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="clientId">client identifier to check</param>
    /// <returns>true/false whether it is visible to the client or not</returns>
    private bool CheckVisibility(ulong clientId)
    {
        // If not spawned, then always return false
        if (!IsSpawned)
        {
            return false;
        }

        // We can do a simple distance check between the NetworkObject instance position and the client
        return Vector3.Distance(NetworkManager.ConnectedClients[clientId].PlayerObject.transform.position, transform.position) <= VisibilityDistance;
    }

    public override void OnNetworkSpawn()
    {
        if (IsServer)
        {
            // The server handles visibility checks and should subscribe when spawned locally on the server-side.
            NetworkObject.CheckObjectVisibility += CheckVisibility;
            // If we want to continually update, we don't need to check every frame but should check at least once per tick
            if (ContinuallyCheckVisibility)
            {
                NetworkManager.NetworkTickSystem.Tick += OnNetworkTick;
            }                
        }
        base.OnNetworkSpawn();
    }

    private void OnNetworkTick()
    {
        // If CheckObjectVisibility is enabled, check the distance to clients
        // once per network tick.
        foreach (var clientId in NetworkManager.ConnectedClientsIds)
        {
            var shouldBeVisibile = CheckVisibility(clientId);
            var isVisibile = NetworkObject.IsNetworkVisibleTo(clientId);
            if (shouldBeVisibile && !isVisibile)
            {
                // Note: This will invoke the CheckVisibility check again
                NetworkObject.NetworkShow(clientId);
            }
            else if (!shouldBeVisibile && isVisibile)
            {
                NetworkObject.NetworkHide(clientId);
            }
        }
    }

    public override void OnNetworkDespawn()
    {
        if (IsServer)
        {
            NetworkObject.CheckObjectVisibility -= CheckVisibility;
            NetworkManager.NetworkTickSystem.Tick -= OnNetworkTick;
        }
        base.OnNetworkDespawn();
    }
}
```

### Additional Visibility Methods and Properties:
The `CheckObjectVisibility` callback helps you determine if a `NetworkObject` is visible to a specific client when the `NetworkObject` is spawned.  However, you might have the need to change a `NetworkObject`'s visibility after it's spawned.  To change the visibility of a `NetworkObject` that is already spawned, you can use the following methods:

Make a `NetworkObject` visible to a single client:
```csharp
NetworkObject netObject = GetComponent<NetworkObject>();
netObject.NetworkShow(clientIdToShowTo);
```

Make a `NetworkObject` invisible/hidden from a single client:
```csharp
NetworkObject netObject = GetComponent<NetworkObject>();
netObject.NetworkHide(clientIdToHideFrom);
```

Make several `NetworkObject`s visible to a single client (static method):
```csharp
/// networkObjects is of type List<NetworkObject>
NetworkObject.NetworkShow(networkObjects, clientId);
```

Make several `NetworkObject`s invisible/hidden to a single client (static method):
```csharp
/// networkObjects is of type List<NetworkObject>
NetworkObject.NetworkHide(networkObjects, clientId);
```

Spawn a NetworkObject with no observers (_i.e. not visible to any clients initially_):
```csharp
NetworkObject.SpawnWithObservers = false;
NetworkObject.Spawn();
```

See [Spawning With (or Without) Observers](networkobject.md#spawning-with-or-without-observers) for more information.
