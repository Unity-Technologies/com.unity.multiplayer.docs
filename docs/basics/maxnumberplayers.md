title: Limiting the maximum number of players
---

Netcode for Gameobjects (Netcode) provides a way to customize the [connection approval process](connection-approval.md) that can reject incoming connections based on any number of user-specific reasons.
​

Boss Room provides one example of how to handle limiting the number of players through the connection approval process:

Boss Room provides an example of such delegate

```csharp reference
https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.samples.coop/blob/main/Assets/Scripts/Gameplay/ConnectionManagement/ServerGameNetPortal.cs#L176
```
​
The code below shows an example of an over-capacity check that would prevent more than a certain pre-defined number of players from connecting.
​
```csharp
if( m_Portal.NetManager.ConnectedClientsIds.Count >= CharSelectData.k_MaxLobbyPlayers )
{
    return ConnectStatus.ServerFull;
}
```
​
:::tip**SUBJECT TO CHANGE:**
​
In connection approval delegate Netcode does not support an ability to send anything more than a boolean back.
Boss Room demonstrates a way to provide meaningful error code to the client by invoking a client RPC in the same channel that Netcode uses for its connection callback.

:::

When using Relay, ensure the maximum number of peer connections allowed by the host satisfies the logic implemented in the connection approval delegate.
