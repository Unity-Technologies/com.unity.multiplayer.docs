:::unity About Releases
For Unity experimental releases:

* Expect breaking API changes - using this early has risks! See release notes for extensive information and links to additional content.
* Expect no SLA on timeline to ship patches and fixes to releases, as we are still establishing our test and release cadence.
* Expect these releases to move towards a fuller Release.
* Expect us to answer questions for early adopters on [Discord](https://discord.gg/buMxnnPvTb) and [Forums](https://forum.unity.com/forums/multiplayer.26/). We welcome all feedback and issues logged!
